											<p>High school students are required to take courses in math, science, English, and social studies, no matter what field they’re going into. Not many people learn about finance, yet everyone has to deal with money in life. After graduating, very few people know anything about saving, budgeting, taxes, or anything related. Every high school student should be required to take a course in personal finance so that we can have a smarter, more money-conscious society.</p>

											<p>Marvel has been making hit movies for nearly a decade, but its day in the sun may be coming to a close as it is forced to deal with competition from Star Wars, more characters than anyone can count, and the increasing inaccessibility they bring. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a franchise to seem relevant. Its movie plots are concerned with fantastical problems, but the franchise is set in the real world of 2016 and real problems are not addressed.</p>

											<p>In the wake of a failed military coup in Turkey, there’s been little mention by the media of all the major political players involved and the inevitability of the coup based on Turkey’s history. The military was viewed by the founder of Turkey, Ataturk, as a force of intervention in the event the government becomes too corrupt or Islamic. Four military coups have been conducted in the past. Motivations for this recent coup stem from dictatorial autocratic actions made by President Erdogan. Erdogan blames the attack on Fethullah Gulen, an influential imam and an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy.</p>
