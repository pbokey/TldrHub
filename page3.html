											<p>High school students are required to take courses in math, science, English, and social studies, no matter what field theyâ€™re going into. Not many people learn about finance, yet everyone has to deal with money in life. After graduating, very few people know anything about saving, budgeting, taxes, or anything related. Every high school student should be required to take a course in personal finance so that we can have a smarter, more money-conscious society.</p>
