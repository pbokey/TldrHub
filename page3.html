											<p>Last October, Florida passed a law criminalizing the publication of revenge porn. However, the law is too specific for many offenders to actually be convicted. Some argue that this law is a violation of the First Amendment protection of free speech and is so broad that it doesn’t distinguish pornography from images of breastfeeding or nudity in textbooks. Others say it doesn’t suppress free speech because it falls under an established exception, protects people from psychological harm, and is specific enough to exclude protected materials. Regardless, this controversial law or similar legislation will likely be considered by the Supreme Court. </p>

											<p>We rarely go a week without hearing a story of an attack either inspired or carried out by the Islamic State. Despite all the coverage, there’s still a general lack of understanding on ISIS’s roots. The United States and the Western Coalition’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 toppled the Sunni government, which led to resentful Sunnis forming the extremist group Al-Qaeda. Upon the Arab Spring uprisings, Al-Qaeda in Iraq allied themselves with the Syrian rebels. The members left Al-Qaeda and rebranded themselves as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. </p>

											<p>Ramadan is the one month each year when Muslims across the world refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset for the entire month. Every year as the month progresses, I get bombarded by numerous questions inquiring everything from reasoning to difficulty. It’s a practice in empathy. It forces us to relate to the struggles of the poor on a day-to-day basis. We’ll never truly understand those struggles, but it gives us a sample and makes us thankful for what we do have.</p>

											<p>Despite being an avid Bernie Sanders supporter, I’ll still be voting for Hillary Clinton. Trump’s xenophobic statements and policies reflect his lack of qualifications for the presidency. Clinton’s policies align with Bernie’s, and a Republican supermajority would undo the progress under the Obama Administration. A third-party candidate such a Jill Stein would not win. Clinton may not create a political revolution, but she would add to current progress. We must unify as a party to defeat Donald Trump. We must put aside idealism for pragmatism.</p>

											<p>Marvel has been making hit movies for nearly a decade, but its day in the sun may be coming to a close as it is forced to deal with competition from Star Wars, more characters than anyone can count, and the increasing inaccessibility they bring. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a franchise to seem relevant. Its movie plots are concerned with fantastical problems, but the franchise is set in the real world of 2016 and real problems are not addressed.</p>

											<p>In the wake of a failed military coup in Turkey, there’s been little mention by the media of all the major political players involved and the inevitability of the coup based on Turkey’s history. The military was viewed by the founder of Turkey, Ataturk, as a force of intervention in the event the government becomes too corrupt or Islamic. Four military coups have been conducted in the past. Motivations for this recent coup stem from dictatorial autocratic actions made by President Erdogan. Erdogan blames the attack on Fethullah Gulen, an influential imam and an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy.</p>

											<p>With high rates of obesity, Americans are more likely to resort to fad dieting to lose weight in whatever way they can. These diets can be dangerous and detrimental to one’s health, and they’re only enabled further by the media’s perpetuation of the “ideal body type.” Luckily, safe dieting and exercise are a scientifically proven way to lose weight and to construct a happier, healthier self-image. Being fit is about more than what the scale says; it’s about body positivity and self-love.</p>

											<p>On June 24th Britain left the European Union, and the world in shock. The British pound slumped to its lowest point in 30 years as the stock market dropped off. Racism toward minorities and migrants has run rampant as reported harassment and xenophobic actions increased fivefold. In fact, the split itself was fueled by much of the same isolationist rhetoric we’re hearing in the United States. Many of those who voted to leave wanted to “take back full control” of their borders, sealing them to ensure migrants and refugees are unable to come to Britain.</p>
