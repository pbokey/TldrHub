											<p>High school students are required to take courses in math, science, English, and social studies, no matter what field theyâ€™re going into. Not many people learn about finance, yet everyone has to deal with money in life. After graduating, very few people know anything about saving, budgeting, taxes, or anything related. Every high school student should be required to take a course in personal finance so that we can have a smarter, more money-conscious society.</p>

											<p>Marvel has been making hit movies for nearly a decade, but its day in the sun may be coming to a close as it is forced to deal with competition from Star Wars, more characters than anyone can count, and the increasing inaccessibility they bring. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a franchise to seem relevant. Its movie plots are concerned with fantastical problems, but the franchise is set in the real world of 2016 and real problems are not addressed.</p>
