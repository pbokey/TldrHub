											<p>Marvel has been making hit movies for nearly a decade, but its day in the sun may be coming to a close as it is forced to deal with competition from Star Wars, more characters than anyone can count, and the increasing inaccessibility they bring. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a franchise to seem relevant. Its movie plots are concerned with fantastical problems, but the franchise is set in the real world of 2016 and real problems are not addressed.</p>

											<p>In the wake of a failed military coup in Turkey, there’s been little mention by the media of all the major political players involved and the inevitability of the coup based on Turkey’s history. The military was viewed by the founder of Turkey, Ataturk, as a force of intervention in the event the government becomes too corrupt or Islamic. Four military coups have been conducted in the past. Motivations for this recent coup stem from dictatorial autocratic actions made by President Erdogan. Erdogan blames the attack on Fethullah Gulen, an influential imam and an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy.</p>

											<p>With high rates of obesity, Americans are more likely to resort to fad dieting to lose weight in whatever way they can. These diets can be dangerous and detrimental to one’s health, and they’re only enabled further by the media’s perpetuation of the “ideal body type.” Luckily, safe dieting and exercise are a scientifically proven way to lose weight and to construct a happier, healthier self-image. Being fit is about more than what the scale says; it’s about body positivity and self-love.</p>

											<p>On June 24th Britain left the European Union, and the world in shock. The British pound slumped to its lowest point in 30 years as the stock market dropped off. Racism toward minorities and migrants has run rampant as reported harassment and xenophobic actions increased fivefold. In fact, the split itself was fueled by much of the same isolationist rhetoric we’re hearing in the United States. Many of those who voted to leave wanted to “take back full control” of their borders, sealing them to ensure migrants and refugees are unable to come to Britain.</p>

											<p>Solutions to win the “war on radical Islam” are often accompanied by vast misunderstandings of the true roots of extremism. We forget we’re fighting more than an extremist group—we’re fighting an ideology. We can defeat ISIS, but we can’t defeat radical Islam. All the collapse of ISIS will do is aide the rise of another extremist group, unless we address the political and socioeconomic grievances of the region that make their citizens so malleable to extremist doctrine.</p>

											<p>Despite being an avid Bernie Sanders supporter, I’ll still be voting for Hillary Clinton. Trump’s xenophobic statements and policies reflect his lack of qualifications for the presidency. Clinton’s policies align with Bernie’s, and a Republican supermajority would undo the progress under the Obama Administration. A third-party candidate such a Jill Stein would not win. Clinton may not create a political revolution, but she would add to current progress. We must unify as a party to defeat Donald Trump. We must put aside idealism for pragmatism.</p>

												<p>I’m a liberal, vegetarian, feminist, and former Bernie Sanders campaigner. Possibly the definition of what some might consider an SJW, or social justice warrior. As such, a conservative political summer camp wouldn’t exactly be my scene. But after spending my summer playing volleyball, making late night ice cream runs, listening to conservative guest speakers, and debating my newly-found Republican friends, I came to a realization — friendship is, or at least should be, a bipartisan relationship. Acceptance doesn’t constitute agreement, but it demonstrates willingness to listen to all sides of an issue, and that is the mark of maturity.</p>
