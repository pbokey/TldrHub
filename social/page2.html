											<p>Ramadan is the one month each year when Muslims across the world refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset for the entire month. Every year as the month progresses, I get bombarded by numerous questions inquiring everything from reasoning to difficulty. It’s a practice in empathy. It forces us to relate to the struggles of the poor on a day-to-day basis. We’ll never truly understand those struggles, but it gives us a sample and makes us thankful for what we do have.</p>

											<p>Marvel has been making hit movies for nearly a decade, but its day in the sun may be coming to a close as it is forced to deal with competition from Star Wars, more characters than anyone can count, and the increasing inaccessibility they bring. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a franchise to seem relevant. Its movie plots are concerned with fantastical problems, but the franchise is set in the real world of 2016 and real problems are not addressed.</p>
