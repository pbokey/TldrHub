											<p>Qandeel Baloch, a 26-year-old social media activist from Pakistan, was murdered by her brother in an honor killing in July. The family breadwinner, she was a staunch feminist. Her actions were highly controversial, but she was unapologetic in how she approached life. Baloch inspired many young women with her confidence, and her death has caused the Pakistani government to take a closer look at current laws surrounding honor killings.</p>

											<p>In a world full of mass shootings, terrorism, and hate, why does everyone preach love yet not act on it? It’s time to work on overcoming the hate that seems to be built into our lifestyle and spread a little light in our hurting world. As a community, we need to focus more on loving each other for our similarities and less on hating each other for our differences.</p>

											<p>Adidas has gone beyond the realm of athletics to take on the runway. They’ve teamed up with rapper Kanye West to expand beyond the courts to the street, including urban street wear to their clothing line. Nude colors and earth tones have become a fashion staple, courtesy of Kanye. The infamous “Yeezys” have bridged the gap between casual and activewear into a well-designed sneaker for all occasions. This is the biggest collaboration between a sports brand and non-athlete. Will Kanye become a fashion Icon beyond his 3 seasons of Yeezy? Only time will tell.</p>

											<p>Ramadan is the one month each year when Muslims across the world refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset for the entire month. Every year as the month progresses, I get bombarded by numerous questions inquiring everything from reasoning to difficulty. It’s a practice in empathy. It forces us to relate to the struggles of the poor on a day-to-day basis. We’ll never truly understand those struggles, but it gives us a sample and makes us thankful for what we do have.</p>

											<p>Marvel has been making hit movies for nearly a decade, but its day in the sun may be coming to a close as it is forced to deal with competition from Star Wars, more characters than anyone can count, and the increasing inaccessibility they bring. Furthermore, it may be difficult for a franchise to seem relevant. Its movie plots are concerned with fantastical problems, but the franchise is set in the real world of 2016 and real problems are not addressed.</p>
