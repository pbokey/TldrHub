									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p><span class="city" style = "display:none"></span>
									On July 15, 2016, prominent Pakistani activist Qandeel Baloch, whose real name was Fouzia Azeem, was murdered by her brother for allegedly bringing dishonor to the family. In his confession video, her brother showed no regret and says he was proud of what he did. Despite a growing progressive movement, <a href = "http://hrcp-web.org/hrcpweb/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Women_12.pdf"> a report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan</a> shows that over 800 women died in honor killings last year. After Baloch's death, Pakistanis rallied for the passage of a law to close a loophole that allows families to forgive the killers.  
									<p>A proud feminist, I was an avid follower of Baloch’s posts on social media and grew to love her bold personality. It was no different from the way thousands of 20-something women use social media, sharing new fashions and gushing over celebrity crushes. In the West, this has no consequences. I can post a #mcm and go on with my day, no questions asked. For Baloch, her online antics had fatal repercussions.</p> 
									<p>Maybe I’m tainted by my American upbringing, a product of liberal parents, but it burns me to see how women are so easily disregarded in Pakistan. There are hundreds of Qandeels sitting online right now seeing what being outspoken in such a patriarchal society does, doubts swirling through their mind. It’s 2016, and with the global perspective the Internet provides, even in the villages of Pakistan, punishments for honor killings need to be strictly enforced.</p> 

									<img src="images/photo 2.png" class="post-pic" width="40%" style="float: left; margin-right:30px;margin-bottom: 30px" />
									<blockquote>“As women we must stand up for ourselves. As women we must stand up for each other. As women we must stand up for justice.”</blockquote>

									<p>For every person who thought Baloch was dishonorable, there were a hundred others who supported her every action. She represented a new generation of women in Pakistan who stood up for themselves and didn’t let orthodox values dictate their lives. The family breadwinner, she was a working-class woman who dared to be herself. Her accented English was on display in her videos, and self-deprecating jokes made her that much more real. Through social media, she became an unknowing activist for women’s rights. Days before her death she posted a Michelle Obama quote on Facebook: “As women we must stand up for ourselves. As women we must stand up for each other. As women we must stand up for justice.”</p>
									<p>Baloch had a life like many other women yet she paid the ultimate price for following her dreams. She represents the quintessential American attitude that you make your own destiny, and perhaps this is why she was simultaneously hated and revered in Pakistan. Qandeel Baloch symbolizes the beginning of a culture war between conservative traditions and an increasingly liberal world. Even in death she’s a provocative, brazen, feminist hero who showed hesitant optimism for the future of Pakistan.</p>
