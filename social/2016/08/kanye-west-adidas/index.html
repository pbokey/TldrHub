									<p class="tldr">Adidas has gone beyond the realm of athletics to take on the runway. They’ve teamed up with rapper Kanye West to expand beyond the courts to the street, including urban street wear to their clothing line. Nude colors and earth tones have become a fashion staple, courtesy of Kanye. The infamous “Yeezys” have bridged the gap between casual and activewear into a well-designed sneaker for all occasions. This is the biggest collaboration between a sports brand and non-athlete. Will Kanye become a fashion Icon beyond his 3 seasons of Yeezy? Only time will tell. </p>

							On June 29th, Adidas announced a clothing line of casual and activewear in collaboration with musical artist Kanye West, as well as revealed plans to open retail stores just for the collaboration. This is not only big news for Kanye but also to the brand he helped revitalize. 
							</p>

							<p>
							It is no secret that, for the past decade, Adidas has been considered “the poor man’s Nike.” Everyone wanted the swoosh. However, thanks to Kanye West, Adidas is now back in the game and maybe even taking the lead.
							</p>

							<p>
							We all remember the first Yeezy show. In February of 2015, the solemn yet statuesque models dressed in nude colors and earthtones became known as a staple trend in fashion. The collection quickly became the influence for many wardrobes, including the Kardashian family. The highlight of the collection were the shoes. Kanye linked with Adidas and gave birth to the Yeezy Boost 360, a beautifully designed high-end sneaker that took the world of footwear by storm. With the introduction of the new Yeezy Boost 750 this past spring, the shoe’s popularity has designated the release of the shoe’s “Yeezy Season”.
							</p> 


							<p>
							The partnership between Adidas and Kanye continues to grow, stating that their collaboration with Yeezus will go beyond shoes; the singer will pair with the brand to create a full line of clothing. Even further so, Adidas also announced they will be opening "Yeezy retail stores" solely for the collaboration. The deal is not just for casual wear though -- the agreement is said to cross into active wear as well, giving Kanye another barrier to break with his artistic genius.
							</p> 

							<p>
							This is the biggest partnership between a sports brand and non-athlete, sparking the first major collaboration of this scale. While Rihanna’s Puma line or Beyoncé’s IVY PARK from Top Shop have struck exclusive fashion deals that sell out fast, Mr. West's new deal has the public and the fashion industry turning heads.
							</p> 

							<p>
							Will Kanye become a fashion Icon beyond his 3 seasons of Yeezy? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure, I’m already saving up for what can only be called the fashion collaboration of the year.
