While there is much to be done to aid the failure of the right brain, the first step may be changing the GPA weight of fine arts classes in high schools.

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>Authors Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman <a href = http://www.newsweek.com/creativity-crisis-74665>found that the public’s “creativity quotient” has been declining during the past 20 years in their article “The Creativity Crisis.”</a> According to dictionary.com, creativity is “the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.” The innovation and problem solving that creativity sparks makes the world a better place in the long run; it is an important quality to have no matter what the field or occupation. In modern society, there is an obvious emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math careers. These are important for the betterment and development of society, but as the world has been forgetting more and more recently, so are the arts. If we continue to discourage creativity in our education systems, then eventually innovation will be snuffed out. How do we keep creativity alive? 
							</p>
							<p>
							Even though I’m planning on a career in science, creative arts have a very important place in my heart. Since I was four years old, playing violin has been a key part of my life. I owe so many of my qualities and habits to that instrument: composition, practice, unity, commitment. During the entirety of middle school, I participated in an orchestra class, and I was excited to continue with it when I began high school. But there was an evident shift in atmosphere in this bigger, more serious school. Because of my personal investment in creative arts, I was able to clearly see the inattention to fine arts courses in school systems.  
							</p>
							<blockquote>"The innovation and problem solving that creativity sparks makes the world a better place in the long run; it is an important quality to have no matter what the field or occupation."</blockquote>
							<p>
							While it will take extensive research and planning to figure out a definitive plan to nurse creativity back to health, there are few obvious fixes. Studies show that young children express a substantial interest in art, but by high school students have trained their brains in the opposite fashion. My high school orchestra class, along with most other fine arts courses, is weighted less than an honors or Advanced Placement credit, and is essentially detrimental to any student’s GPA. After having it drilled into our minds that colleges like big GPAs, students are given incentives to take highly weighted courses and in turn, not to take these right-side-of-the-brain courses. We can make a huge impact just by focusing on more well-rounded schedules during primary and secondary education. 
							</p>
							<p>
							We often forget that from art to science to management, creativity is a necessary part of problem solving; it is important to keep both sides of the brain “in shape.” If we don’t manage to find and execute a solution to the creativity problem, I imagine that the world will fizzle out into a dark age of statistics and formulas, unable to create and solve problems in new ways. We cannot let this happen, and so it is again that I ask: How do we keep creativity alive?
