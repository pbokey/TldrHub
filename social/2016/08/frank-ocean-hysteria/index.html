And as each rumor turns out to be fake, Frank’s fans continue to get more desperate for the album to come out. Many artists would disclaim the rumors or just right out reveal when they will release their album, but not Frank. He uses the frustration of his audience to put more attention into his name. As they use social media to show their frustration, Frank is blissfully enjoying all the free PR he is getting.

									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p>
									<p>
									At the time of publication of this article, famous R&B singer Frank Ocean has not released his album “Boys Don’t Cry.” For many people that’s a pretty big deal — his fans have been anxiously waiting for this album to drop. Ever since his album “Channel Orange” came out in 2012, there have been many rumors of the “Boys Don’t Cry” release date, all proving false. His fans have been in emotional turmoil about this album because of it. For this reason, Frank Ocean is a genius.
									</p>
									
									<p>
									How is playing with the emotions of your fanbase “genius”? Well, it’s simple. Frank Ocean’s audience is mainly millennials, who are stereotypically known for their avid use of social media. Expressing emotions through a tweet, snapchat story, Tumblr post, etc. is part of the lifestyle that millennials live, and Frank Ocean notices this and uses it to his advantage. Whenever there is a rumor that “Boys Don’t Cry” is going to drop, Frank Ocean neither confirms nor denies that it will- he just let’s things take its course. As each frenzied fan posts on social media about a rumor related to Frank Ocean’s album drop, his fan base will grow. It’s hard to see someone desperately tweet about a mysterious album and not want to investigate what it’s about.
									</p>
									
									<p>
									There are many emotions involved when it comes to a “Boys Don’t Cry” rumor. I should know; I have suffered through multiple false rumors of album drop dates. First comes the excitement. Maybe a tweet made by a big twitter account or an article from a news website says there are rumors of the drop date for the Frank Ocean album. Once the rumor is introduced, it spreads like wildfire, and soon enough, everyone who is interested in Frank Ocean finds out about the rumor. Then comes the day of the alleged drop date, and places like twitter goes nuts with anticipation. The day that this article was written was one of those rumor days. Things like “Frank Ocean” and “Boys Don’t Cry” were trending worldwide on Twitter, as the anticipation for his album continues to rise. Midnight struck, no album. Hours passed, still no album. The day came to a close, and yet, there was still no album. The emotions of the fans are starting to change from excitement to disappointment and anger. Like they did when they were excited about the rumors, they start posting about how disappointed they are that the rumors were yet again proven untrue. When the day comes to an end, Frank Ocean will have gained many new and confused followers—all because of the hype surrounding his rumored album release date.
									</p>
									
									<p>
									As the rumor spreads, Frank Ocean’s popularity increases. This is why Frank Ocean is a genius. He uses these rumors. Unlike many artists and celebrities these days who would dismiss a rumor the moment it comes out, he grabs the rumors by the horns and takes advantage of it. At the end of the day, Frank’s fans might be disappointed, but Frank isn’t. He just got a lot of attention for free, all because someone said “Boys don’t Cry”.
