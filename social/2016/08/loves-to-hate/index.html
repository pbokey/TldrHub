It’s time to work on overcoming the hate that seems to be built into our lifestyle and spread a little light in our hurting world. As a community, we need to focus more on loving each other for our similarities and less on hating each other for our differences.

									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p>Think back to a time when you ate at a new restaurant and saw new foods on the menu. Did you try them? Or was your first thought “eh, it’s different and might be bad so I don’t want to waste my money?” Psychology tells us that humans group things into things they know, and things they don’t know, separating familiar from unfamiliar. Things we don’t know are automatically grouped as “bad” or at least “not preferable.” This idea, stemming from human need to survive, was a perfectly reasonable deduction when an unknown food could mean death, but this mentality sneaks its way into 21st century thinking and is working to tear us apart.</p>

									<p>I would bet good money that all the readers of this article consider themselves to be knowledgeable, reasonable people that can appreciate a different point of view. But I would bet a larger sum of money that there is at least one issue that you cannot stand to hear arguments against your side. Pick any relevant divisive topic: gun control, abortion, #BlackLivesMatter, terrorism, taxes, or gender definitions. There is at least one subject in that list that you hear people on Facebook rant about and you just can’t stand it, because you know in your heart that they are WRONG. No matter what they say, you have the facts, you have thought long and hard and made your decision and you KNOW you are right.</p>

									<p>So why do they disagree? Why can’t some people just understand what is right and agree with you? The issue lies at the root of what makes you, you. All your experiences and memories and hard-learned lessons accumulate and shape the reality you see. But consider this: that “wrong” person on Facebook had different parents, grew up in a different home, and had a different life than you. That means their world is different than yours, which seems obvious until you really think about the implications of that statement. 2+2=4 because everything you have learned and been told makes that statement make sense. But what if your whole life, you had learned that 2+2=5? Everything you had ever learned proved it until you were 100% sure it was true. Then someone tells you that 2+2=4. Two people that take the same situation, and draw different conclusions, how do they reconcile? Someone must be wrong, right?</p>

									<p>This division has led to countless religious wars, hate crimes, and atrocities throughout time. The human race decided a long time ago that if you can’t eliminate the idea, you eliminate the person. Everyone feels this anger toward people that are “wrong.” How do we just make them believe in our side? The founding fathers bypassed this problem in politics by creating the Electoral College. The Islamic State decided to kill anyone who doesn’t believe their views.</p>

									<p>There is an infinite amount of differences between you and I. I have too many friends that believe different things than me to hate people that don’t agree with me. So instead of calling for gun control on Facebook, or condemning BLM, or killing abortion doctors, or fighting all the time, why don’t humans focus on what makes us similar? If you believe the world is flat, but you love music, so what? Let’s talk about music! Life is too short to hate. Try a little understanding instead. And who knows? Someone might just change your whole reality.</p>
