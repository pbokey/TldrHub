Why do heterosexuals need a day dedicated to their sexual orientation when they don’t fear for their life because of it? By calling for a #HeterosexualPrideDay, people are erasing the struggles the LGBT community has faced and continues to face.</p>

							<p>
							In the wake of the mass shooting of 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub, Pulse, and just a few days after New York’s gay pride festival, millions of people took to Twitter and other social media to celebrate #HeterosexualPrideDay. Here’s what I have to say to them.
							</p>
							<p>
							Remember the darkness? How suffocating it felt to hide behind the mask of singing the “proper” pronouns in love songs or fabricating opposite sex crushes just to seem “normal”? Remember so desperately craving to understand and to be understood but not having anywhere to look to or someone to share the most innate part of your being with because of the crippling fear of being rejected? 
							</p>
							<p>
							Remember the shame? How it felt the first time you realized you couldn’t hold your lover’s hand in public for fear of being physically assaulted? How people diagnosed your love for others as a perverse sickness equal to that of defiling an animal? How people told you you’d go to hell for loving someone? 
							</p>
							<p>
							Remember the vulnerability? How you actually felt naked and a mere two feet tall every time someone used your love and your attraction as a way to insult someone else? How people nonchalantly discussed their belief that because of who you loved, you were less than human? That denying you any rights was God’s way?
							</p>
							<p>
							<strong>You do not remember because you are not queer.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							You have never experienced harassment or assault or shame or any other negative action or emotion for the sole reason of your sexuality. 
							</p>
							<p>
							We live in a world built for heterosexuals and cisgendered people. No one looks twice when they see a straight couple engaging in public displays of affection at the park or in a restaurant. From the moment you are born you are assumed straight, you are assumed cisgendered and the instant you greet the world with a cry and are placed into someone’s arms, society forces these expectations and their assumed behaviors onto you. 
							</p>
							<p>
							For those who actually are straight and cisgendered, this seems to be no problem for you. In fact, in many ways it helps you - you are immediately taught how society expects you to act and present yourself, leaving you little room for confusion or questioning your place in the world.
							</p>
							<p>
							For those of us who aren’t actually straight or cisgender, our authentic selves are continually repressed and unknowingly beaten down. It takes us serious soul searching and confusion and heartbreak to figure out who we truly are, and this process doesn’t come without serious side effects. 
							</p>
							<p>
							For example, <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss60e0606.pdf">according to a study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, questioning youth are three times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers, and Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) youth are four times more likely. These statistics dramatically increase when discussing trans folk. <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17967119">About half of transgender youth have contemplated suicide, and 25% of transgender youth have attempted suicide.</a>
							</p>
							<p>
							Additionally, of the more than two million homeless youths in the United States, <a target = "_blank" href = "https://truecolorsfund.org/our-issue/">up to 40% of them identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender (LGBT).</a> 86% of  <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.glsen.org/research">LGBT youth are harassed at school</a>, compared to 27% of all students being bullied at school. 92% of LGBT youth say they hear negative things about themselves on a daily basis. In fact, <a href = "https://nobullying.com/lgbt-bullying-statistics/"> a study by Mental Health America </a>found that students heard derogatory comments like “fag” every 15 minutes.
							</p>
							<p>
							<strong>No such data is applicable to heterosexuals.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							With these forces constantly trying to tear us queer people down, a day — just one single day out of the 365 days that make up a year — dedicated to accepting and loving ourselves and being proud of being a part of the LGBT community is a sensible, even conservative break from the constant negativity queer people face on a daily basis. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I remember the light I felt when attending my first pride festival. How the rainbow-clad plaza looked like the hopeful arch at the end of every horrible storm, and I finally felt understood.
							</p>
							<p>
							I remember the acceptance I felt when attending my first pride festival. How I was surrounded by love and how people of all genders and sexualities courageously took hold of their lovers’ hands.
							</p>
							<p>
							I remember the power I felt when attending my first pride festival. How my shame dissipated when I opened myself up and proudly pronounced my sexuality and demanded equal treatment.
							</p>
							<p>
							I remember because I am queer and deserve a safe place to feel loved and accepted. 
							In regards to their heterosexuality, straight people always feel the light, the acceptance, and the power I feel during gay pride. So answer me this, those who support #HeterosexualPrideDay, why must there be a day dedicated to accepting your straightness? That’s every day for you.
