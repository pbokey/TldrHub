							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>
							<p>
							Thank you for your prayers.
							Thank you for your hashtags.
							Thank you for your thoughts.
							Thank you for your solidarity.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							But we’re still here, and we’re still hurting.
 							</p>

							<p>
							Every day I see a new fundraising event pop up on my Facebook feed. I go to as many as I can, but there’s only so much one person can take. My heart has given all it can give, and my sympathy is drained.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							Now I’m just angry.  
							</p>
 
							<p>
							Angry that I’ve seen news of other mass shootings every day since our tragedy. Angry that nothing has been done. The Dickey amendment still stands, no new gun legislation has been passed, and people still romanticize gun ownership, wielding them loud and proud as if nothing ever happened. Immediate legislation could have saved lives. I’ve written to my representative and my senators, gone to rallies, and read up on voting records for the 2016 election, but #OrlandoUnited is all people seem to have taken away from any of this.
							</p>

							<p>Now there’s been another Florida club shooting, but this time it was children. The two victims who died were only 14 and 18, the youngest rushed to the hospital was 12, the oldest was 27. There were massive amounts of security, but the assailant targeted the parent pick-up location of the Ft. Meyers kid’s club.
							<p>

							<p>
							Someone targeted a middle/high school event, and we let them.
							<p>

							<p>
							Our next president may be someone who never gave sincere condolences, or visited, or talked to us. By only wanting our “congratulations,” he could leave us behind, and we’re letting him.
							</p>

							<p>
							Even in a post-Pulse America, one of the most outspoken homophobes in politics may become our Vice President come January, and we’re letting him.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							We’re still crying out in Orlando and no one seems to be hearing our voices. They’re being muffled by those in Dallas, Nice, and Munich.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							For those who prefer to pray, please remember: “But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.” James 1:23-25
							</p>
 
							<p>
							And for those who still argue for liberty over safety, check the news every day to understand why that just doesn’t work in this day and age. Come to Orlando, and if the feelings don’t convince you, ask the home of the largest mass shooting in America about the facts on gun violence. 
							</p>

							<p>
							I for one will continue to write my congressmen, annually reminding them that we’re still here and there is still work to be done. Orlando was a shy town, never stealing the spotlight other than the occasional addition to our many theme parks, but now we stand for something greater than tourism. We serve as a reminder of the work to be done in the upcoming election. We are Orlando, we are strong, and we are not stopping the discussion.
