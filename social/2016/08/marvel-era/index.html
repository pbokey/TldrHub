									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p>Ever since <span style = "font-style:italic">Iron Man</span> arrived in theaters in 2008 and surprised everyone by making shiploads of money using a superhero of whom most people hadn’t heard, Hollywood has been producing a steady stream of Marvel films, and the ticket-buying public has been throwing money at them. Even films featuring a gun-shooting raccoon in space, <span style = "font-style:italic">Guardians of the Galaxy</span>, has turned an absurd profit, as did the film about the only men in the world who would want to make themselves smaller. Despite Marvel’s near absolute success for the past eight years, the reign of the comic book king may be coming to an end.</p>
									<p>
									While other studios plodded through with mannequins in spandex, the characters in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe are as unique and human as could be — half the joy of watching a Marvel film is watching the characters bounce off each other and exchange wit. Creating original characters has been Marvel’s strong suit since <span style = "font-style:italic">Iron Man</span>, but it also brings its own problems. For one thing, between all of Marvel’s films and television shows, there are more characters than a centipede could shake a stick at. This, combined with Marvel's addiction to crossovers, cameos, and group get-togethers, means that it’s very hard to enjoy most Marvel films fully if watched in isolation. While Marvel is rolling out quite a few films featuring new heroes, such as <span style = "font-style:italic">Dr. Strange</span> as a part of its Phase 3, it’s very likely that heroes and villains from previous installments will pop in. It's difficult to enjoy a film if you're constantly googling “Which Chris is it this time?” on your phone. This problem is particularly relevant because Marvel's ascendancy started eight years ago, and many of the young people that got hooked now may be dangerously close to getting a life. As fun as inside-jokes and continuity nods are for established fans, they don't bring in a lot of fresh faces.</p>
									<p>Even if Marvel does manage to avoid internal problems, there's the simple matter that this is the first time that Marvel will have to genuinely compete with other heavyweight franchises. The resurrected <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars</span> has already proven that it can beat Marvel in the ticket booth: <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</span> grossed merely twice as much domestically as both <span style = "font-style:italic">Avengers: Age of Ultron</span> and <span style = "font-style:italic">Captain America: Civil War</span> combined (numbers from Box Office Mojo). Furthermore, <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars</span> is not a one-time deal, and it has much bigger plans than making two more films and politely stepping out of Marvel's way again. In fact, there are plans for one <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars</span> film each year until 2020, at least.</p>
									<p>In the age of the internet and rampant pirating, people aren't going to the cinema once every weekend or even once every month; when the choices are yet another superhero movie with heroes whose names one can barely remember or everyone's favorite spaceship, cinema-goers may very well prefer to go see that spaceship on the big screen. <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars</span> also avoids Marvel's aforementioned problem with an overstuffed cast. Unlike superhero movies wherein everyone rises from the dead like an endless stream of impressively ripped, spandex-wearing zombies, <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars</span> has never had too many qualms about trimming the cast. From offing the only interesting villain in <span style = "font-style:italic">The Phantom Menace</span> to nearly giving Han Solo two in the hat because of contract negotiations, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away is genuinely a dangerous place to live.</p>
									<p>However, the problem with Marvel in this day and age goes beyond the movies themselves. It is a universally acknowledged truth that 2016 not been a great year for those of us trapped on planet Earth, and the latter half of 2015 wasn't great either. Between last summer and the present day, the world has been shocked with several high profile terrorist attacks, governmental upheaval in several countries (democratic and otherwise), and the U.S. presidential election has become more than vaguely terrifying for people on both sides of the aisle. This may not seem particularly relevant to superheroes and spandex, but the media we create and consume is always a reflection of our time. For instance, during the start of the Cold War in the 1950s, cinema-goers devoured films such as <span style = "font-style:italic">THEM!</span> and  <span style = "font-style:italic">Godzilla</span>, which tapped into fears such as nuclear radiation and atomic bombs, while the 1940s gave us the beautiful sight of Captain America sucker-punching Hitler for obvious reasons. Marvel's new movies promise large battles and the end of the world (unless one of the Chrises can stop it. SPOILER: they will), but they're dealing with problems that we don't have, such as super villains and a government that actually does something, while existing in what looks like our world.</p>
									<p>At the same time, other franchises such as <span style = "font-style:italic">Star Wars</span> have the advantage of an entirely fictional setting that allows the stories to be purely escapist. The Jedi attacking evil space balls is fun when it's in a galaxy far far away, but if all Captain America does is punch people over space magic stones when people in the real world are dealing with terrorist attacks and government instabilities, the film is not going to resonate with the viewers. Marvel's formula of fantastic plots and improbable threats worked well when the world was relatively quiet and everyone had already forgotten overseas conflicts, but the troubles of the world are becoming uncomfortably close to home.</p>
									<p>While there is still plenty of time before most of Marvel's Phase 3 films are released, Marvel is once again hobbled by the exact same thing that made it great: special effects and a large budget. While a small studio piece can be made in a matter of a year or so, the amount of time it takes to put together a cinematic spectacle such as <span style = "font-style:italic">The Avengers</span> means that Marvel can't respond and adjust according to world events quickly. In a world as terrifying and unpredictable as this one is right now, the Marvel behemoth is out of luck.</p>
									<p>While I am hardly predicting that everyone will stop going to Marvel movies and that Disney will promptly stop producing them, I do believe that Marvel will lose its position as one of the superpowers of popular culture.</p>
