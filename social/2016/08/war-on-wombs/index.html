									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p>Religious and government propaganda in the media are constantly condemning and demonizing women who get abortions (and people who give abortions). What people don’t consider is that every woman thinks long and hard before she decides to terminate a fetus. Frankly, it’s not a decision anyone should take lightly. However frivolous a person she could be, the ending of a potential life is a sobering topic. Trust that she has a reason. A good reason:</p>
									<p><strong>We’ll call her Faye.</strong>
									Faye is unable to support a(n additional) child. She has a big family of four kids already. Her male partner tries to help out, but he grew up in a traditional American household with a stay-at-home-mom and has zero clue how to keep house. Despite his good intentions, Faye is a living reality for the average woman by doing double the unpaid work the average man does: the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry—if she unrolled her to-do list off the edge of a cliff, it’d be as deep as her debt (from university, buying her house, her dad’s medical bills). Emotionally and physically exhausted, you can probably imagine her horror when she’s on her knees, peering into a toilet bowl where her dinner of hot dogs is swimming. Sauerkraut, normally her favourite guilty pleasure, had always unsettled her stomach during her four pregnancies. Faye doesn’t even have the money, time, or patience to raise the kids she already has, let alone another one.</p>
									<p>
									Or maybe Faye is living paycheque to paycheque and can barely support herself. Maybe Faye has a drug habit. Maybe Faye is about to do time in a prison. Maybe Faye has a disability that won’t allow her to take care of a child. Maybe Faye has a terminal disease and won’t be able to be with her kid for long. Maybe Faye doesn’t have a suitable environment in which to raise a kid.</p>
									<p><strong>Faye does not want to have this child.</strong> It was senior year of college, and Faye had made up her mind that she wasn’t going to squander it by being hung up on her ex-boyfriend. Her friends took her to a bar for drinks, where she met a cute guy after five too many cosmos. After a couple hours of chatting and awkward dancing, she suggests that they get out of there. Waking up with a pounding headache the next morning, she rushes out of a foreign apartment to get to class, but not faster than she rushes out of CVS two months later with bag full of pregnancy tests. While the tests flashed pink plus signs, Faye didn’t feel positive about the pregnancy at all. It didn’t make any sense to her; she’d been on birth control and never missed a day. She wasn’t ready to have a kid yet. She still had school ahead of her, her career—she hadn’t even found the one yet. She didn’t want to give all of it up and then blame her kid for it. She wanted to do it in her own time, when the circumstances were perfect.</p>
									<p> 
									Or maybe Faye and her wife found out during an ultrasound that the child would have a congenital disease and didn’t want it to juggle life between home and a hospital. Maybe Faye doesn’t like children and didn’t plan on ever having children. Maybe Faye is afraid of childbirth. Maybe Faye doesn’t want to bring another child into this world when there are so many children without parents whom she could adopt instead. Maybe Faye was never taught about contraception in school because her school board thought it was perverse to teach sexual education. Or maybe she knew, was really really stupid, made a mistake, and didn’t want to suffer the consequences.</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Faye did not willingly conceive the child.</strong> Her parents had gifted her a beautiful scoop neck cashmere sweater for Christmas and she was excited to wear it to school. Unfortunately, as soon as she stepped into homeroom, her tight-lipped teacher eyed her bare collarbones with disapproval, dished out a detention and sent her to the lost-and-found to forage for something less distracting. Faye fished out a somewhat clean-looking hoodie and slid into it. It fit her like a huge garbage bag. After school, she served her detention, and then began the walk home sullenly. “You want to talk about it?” her older brother’s friend, Ben, had walked up beside her and flashed her a smile. After a horrible day, she welcomed his friendliness and didn’t hesitate when he suggested that they meet up with her brother at the park. By the time they got to the park, it was dark and there was no sign of her brother. There was no sign of anyone. “Oh, he’s not here. That’s strange, but we can still hang out anyway, the two of us,” he said with his eyes on her lips.</p>
									<p>
									Or maybe Ben was her uncle asking her to sit on his lap at Thanksgiving. Maybe Ben was her step-father who eased in her bed in the middle of the night. Maybe Ben was her coach giving her a few extra tips after practice. Maybe Ben was a drunk stranger who went to a prestigious west coast school and was hanging out near the dumpsters at the back of a nightclub. Faye didn’t want to raise a kid she would grow to hate.</p>
									<hr class = hr7 />
									<p>
									Faye had an abortion for any of the reasons above, but at the end of the day, her reasons don’t matter. At the end of the day, she owns her body and her life; she lives with the consequences and you do not. She is entitled to a safe and affordable abortion. She is entitled to live the own life she wants. She doesn’t have to have a kid if she doesn’t want to and you can’t force her to. It’s not up to you, me, her partner, her family, the government, a religion, or society to judge her actions or control her body. Faye is a real, living, existing person who has a fully functioning brain in her head and is capable of making her choice. And her choice is hers alone.</p>
