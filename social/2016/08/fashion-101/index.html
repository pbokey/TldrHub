							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>
							Everyone knows of the calendar (January through December) and many know of fiscal calendars (often October through September), but few know of the Fashion Calendar, which starts in September and ends in August. With the start of a “New Year” approaching for the fashion industry, many things are setting the stage, most notably the September issue of Vogue, which was just released. The September issue is the most important issue of the entire year because it gives the world of fashion an idea of what is to come in the following 12 months. New trends are set, new designers are put in the spotlight, new models are found, and a new atmosphere for the entire fashion community is created. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Anna Wintour — the Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Magazine — and her team have worked tirelessly for months on an issue that is sure to impress. The cover itself is considered one of the most important parts, and to adorn the cover is measured as one of fashion’s highest honors. Past names such as Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Kate Moss, and Jennifer Lawrence have proven that posing on the cover of a September issue is not for the faint-hearted. 
							</p>

							<p>
							This year’s covergirl is definitely not faint-hearted, if not one of the bravest and boldest young women in the world, Kendall Jenner. Her hard work and extreme professionalism have earned her not only the name of modern-day supermodel, but a name in the fashion community that is seldom thought of when discussing a Kardashian sister (although the idea that the Kardashian/Jenner family is anything less than brilliant, hardworking, and respectful is complete and total BS). After the cover was announced, Jenner, in an interview with Vogue about <a target = "_blank" href= "http://www.vogue.com/13464198/kendall-jenner-september-cover-model-kardashians/"> her life and the September issue</a> said: “People say a lot of what they think, and it’s not always positive. And we never say anything. We just take it. And then when people meet us, they’re pleasantly surprised. Because we aren’t what people think. One of the best lessons I ever learned from my sisters is not to take everything so seriously. Just leave it alone — it will pass in a week. That’s how I grew up. My sisters are ... strong, and they taught me and my little sister to just toughen up and not let it affect us. You know what’s real.”
							</p>

							<p>
							The most noticeable thing about the September issue is the size. This year the magazine will be a mere 800+ pages. (Every other issue runs about 150 pages, give or take.) The largest September issue was in 2012, when Lady Gaga graced the cover of the 916-page fashion bible (another name for the Vogue magazine).
							</p>

							<p>
							The Vogue September issue is a staple in the fashion world, and if you have any slight interest in fashion, advertising, journalism, models, photography, or Kendall Jenner, I highly recommend going out and buying the issue when it hits stands on September 1st.
