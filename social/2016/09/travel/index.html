							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>Catching a bug usually isn’t a good thing. The term “bug” is referred to as a sickness. When December rolls around and the winter weather comes in, everyone seems to catch a cold. And it spreads, like wildfire, in schools and offices and everywhere in-between. But there is one bug out there that you can catch and find yourself happier with life than ever before. </p>
							<p>
							The travel bug is one that you can’t catch seasonally. One that some people never catch in their lifetime. It comes situationally, and only certain people can grasp the idea of falling in love with travel. Travel is not only a fun experience done by people looking to get away from their busy day-to-day lives and vacate to relaxing places on Earth. Traveling has positive effects, and I am a firm believer that people who travel live healthier, happier, and more open lifestyles.</p>
							<p>
							Traveling to different areas of the world provides intangible benefits that one can only achieve naturally when traveling. When people travel abroad they get to see how others in this world actually live. This undoubtedly will open a traveler’s eyes to new traditions and customs, allowing them to expand their mind in ways unachievable without traveling. Putting life into perspective and seeing how blessed we are here in the United States is a humbling experience, leaving travelers more grateful or appreciative of what they have in their lives and in essence making them more loving and caring people.</p>
							<p>
							Not only can it affect you mentally, traveling has its ways of changing people physically. Oftentimes when traveling, people must endure certain physical activities to get the most out of their experience. Monuments, sightseeing spots, and other touristy activities can sometimes require a walk, hike, or even climb to reach the destination. This forces travelers to get active and perform physical activities. Another idea is that traveling itself will lead people to perform certain physical feats that they normally wouldn’t take part in such as mountain biking or snorkeling/diving, depending on their travel destinations. The fact that traveling entails some exercises unarguably lends itself to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
							<p>
							Lastly comes the unpredictability of travel and the bumps in the road that often make themselves prominent in any travel plans. Although traveling is usually a well thought out process planned months or even years in advance, minor inconveniences almost always occur during a vacation. The nature of dealing with unexpected problems is a good one to get used to as it is likely to happen in personal, professional, and any other times in your life. Travelers will have to remain flexible and sometimes think or plan very quickly in order to solve problems. This can apply to everyday life, and after traveling people can find themselves quick on their feet when it comes to problem solving.</p>
