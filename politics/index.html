									<p class="tldr"><span class = "tldr-heading">too long; didn't read: </span>The South African political party founded by Nelson Mandela known as the African National Congress has reached its first competitor since the end of Apartheid. The Democratic Alliance has gained increasing control, ensuring that the new political party will have representation in the government. South Africa has not only created plurality in their single dominant party system, but has endorsed a temporary end to the nation’s notorious racial politics. As one of the most corrupt and unequal nations in the world, the future of South Africa not only holds control of its own, but its influence over all of Africa.</p>

												<p>Brazil is struggling with a corrupt national government, weakened economy, brutal police and gang behavior, and the Zika virus, all while trying to host the Olympics. The Olympics Games have grown into a multibillion-dollar event, which has caused revenue, coverage, and scandal to multiply. The IOC pits cities against each other to compete for the Olympic bid, searching for the city can produce the most lavish and extravagant Olympics plan. This increases the burden on host nations, which are often unable to foot the bill. This practice is unsustainable and is proof that the IOC needs to be reformed. </p>

												<p>As a feminist and aspiring politician, Hillary Clinton’s career, campaign, and DNC speech have inspired me to strive to achieve my greatest heights in politics and beyond. Despite all our achievements, until now a woman has never been chosen by a major party to run for the presidency. We’ve made great progress but still have a long way to go. Misogyny quickly ensued with too many men telling our next president to “lower her voice” and “smile.” Being a woman myself, I’ve experienced this as well while discussing politics, I can only hope that her presidency will change this.</p>

												<p>I’m a liberal, vegetarian, feminist, and former Bernie Sanders campaigner. Possibly the definition of what some might consider an SJW, or social justice warrior. As such, a conservative political summer camp wouldn’t exactly be my scene. But after spending my summer playing volleyball, making late night ice cream runs, listening to conservative guest speakers, and debating my newly-found Republican friends, I came to a realization — friendship is, or at least should be, a bipartisan relationship. Acceptance doesn’t constitute agreement, but it demonstrates willingness to listen to all sides of an issue, and that is the mark of maturity.</p>

												<p>As tensions between civilians and police departments grow, accusations and blame are plentiful while solutions are few. Many, like Fox News pundit Bill O’Reilly, have cited black-on-black crime and “black culture” as the true culprit. This takes the focus away from police brutality to the supposed innate savagery of African Americans. But there’s been no mention of “white-on-white” crime. Because both “white-on-white” and “black-on-black” crime is simply crime. Poor whites and poor blacks commit roughly the same amount of crimes. The only reason they usually commit these against their own group is because they live around each other.</p>

												<p>Contrary to Clinton’s beliefs, affordable healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. We’ve grown accustomed to the vast treatments at our disposal, but that doesn’t make it a “right.” Healthcare must be approached as an industry in which services and products are provided for a profit. It isn’t the government’s place to protect consumers from price changes. This may be inconvenient in the short run, but it aides in long-term progress and price. Right now, we’re in an awkward mix between free market development and government intervention—the worst place to be. </p>

												<p>While Trump did in fact receive more votes in Republican primaries than any nominee in history, this statistic is dangerously misleading because voter turnout was also at a record high. Trump only received 45% of the vote, making him the least popular GOP nominee in modern history. In the context of the last few decades, though, this could just indicate party disunity. Democrats have had different trends that are harder to decipher. Regardless, this will be one of the most important elections in U.S. history.</p>

Political parties have their place — allowing like-minded individuals to come together and to voice their opinions — but they have made us lazy and forced us to not even consider the stances of a different party. Big money in politics has made politicians slaves to extreme party ideology and lobbyists. We must focus on bipartisan issues to create a stronger, more “united” America.</p>

Despite differences, it was the people who had the biggest excuse to discriminate and demonize that chose to embrace those differences and come together as a community. The entire Orlando community came together to aid the victims. If multiple communities within Orlando who are seemingly so different can come together, why can’t politicians?</p>

Going into this election, we need to seriously consider the character of our candidates when voting.</p>
