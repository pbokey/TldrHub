												<p>I can’t tell you much about the detailed policies of the 2016 presidential candidates, but I can chime in on the image that the candidates are painting for themselves and the United States through their social presences, and how that image will affect our country. Trump has portrayed himself as childish and racist, while Clinton has come off as untrustworthy and out-of-touch. Going into this election, we need to seriously consider the character of our candidates when voting.</p>

												<p>Last October, Florida passed a law criminalizing the publication of revenge porn. However, the law is too specific for many offenders to actually be convicted. Some argue that this law is a violation of the First Amendment protection of free speech and is so broad that it doesn’t distinguish pornography from images of breastfeeding or nudity in textbooks. Others say it doesn’t suppress free speech because it falls under an established exception, protects people from psychological harm, and is specific enough to exclude protected materials. Regardless, this controversial law or similar legislation will likely be considered by the Supreme Court. </p>

												<p>We rarely go a week without hearing a story of an attack either inspired or carried out by the Islamic State. Despite all the coverage, there’s still a general lack of understanding on ISIS’s roots. The United States and the Western Coalition’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 toppled the Sunni government, which led to resentful Sunnis forming the extremist group Al-Qaeda. Upon the Arab Spring uprisings, Al-Qaeda in Iraq allied themselves with the Syrian rebels. The members left Al-Qaeda and rebranded themselves as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. </p>

												<p>Despite being an avid Bernie Sanders supporter, I’ll still be voting for Hillary Clinton. Trump’s xenophobic statements and policies reflect his lack of qualifications for the presidency. Clinton’s policies align with Bernie’s, and a Republican supermajority would undo the progress under the Obama Administration. A third-party candidate such a Jill Stein would not win. Clinton may not create a political revolution, but she would add to current progress. We must unify as a party to defeat Donald Trump. We must put aside idealism for pragmatism.</p>

												<p>In the wake of a failed military coup in Turkey, there’s been little mention by the media of all the major political players involved and the inevitability of the coup based on Turkey’s history. The military was viewed by the founder of Turkey, Ataturk, as a force of intervention in the event the government becomes too corrupt or Islamic. Four military coups have been conducted in the past. Motivations for this recent coup stem from dictatorial autocratic actions made by President Erdogan. Erdogan blames the attack on Fethullah Gulen, an influential imam and an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy.</p>

												<p>Millennials tend to be more concerned about the environment than older generations. This may be for several reasons — we’ve had more exposure to environmental programs than our parents’ generation, and they’re more concerned with national security and economic issues. Public opinion won’t change overnight, but there are many things we can do to push our society toward more environmentally-friendly policies: vote, be seen, be heard, and make small differences.</p>

												<p>Solutions to win the “war on radical Islam” are often accompanied by vast misunderstandings of the true roots of extremism. We forget we’re fighting more than an extremist group—we’re fighting an ideology. We can defeat ISIS, but we can’t defeat radical Islam. All the collapse of ISIS will do is aide the rise of another extremist group, unless we address the political and socioeconomic grievances of the region that make their citizens so malleable to extremist doctrine.</p>
