												<p>In the wake of a failed military coup in Turkey, there’s been little mention by the media of all the major political players involved and the inevitability of the coup based on Turkey’s history. The military was viewed by the founder of Turkey, Ataturk, as a force of intervention in the event the government becomes too corrupt or Islamic. Four military coups have been conducted in the past. Motivations for this recent coup stem from dictatorial autocratic actions made by President Erdogan. Erdogan blames the attack on Fethullah Gulen, an influential imam and an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy.</p>

												<p>Millennials tend to be more concerned about the environment than older generations. This may be for several reasons — we’ve had more exposure to environmental programs than our parents’ generation, and they’re more concerned with national security and economic issues. Public opinion won’t change overnight, but there are many things we can do to push our society toward more environmentally-friendly policies: vote, be seen, be heard, and make small differences.</p>

												<p>Solutions to win the “war on radical Islam” are often accompanied by vast misunderstandings of the true roots of extremism. We forget we’re fighting more than an extremist group—we’re fighting an ideology. We can defeat ISIS, but we can’t defeat radical Islam. All the collapse of ISIS will do is aide the rise of another extremist group, unless we address the political and socioeconomic grievances of the region that make their citizens so malleable to extremist doctrine.</p>
