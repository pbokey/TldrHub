							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>The Olympics have been around for quite some time now. Since Ancient Greek times, actually. Yet, despite the lengthy history of the games, perfecting their facilitation continues to be a struggle for many cities. </p>
							<p>
							In Montreal, Canada, the local community is <a href = http://www.cfr.org/brazil/economics-hosting-olympic-games/p38148> still suffering from the expenses</a> incurred by construction of their grand stadium in 1976. In China, a soaring debt and gross human rights violations is the legacy of the 2008 games.<sup>1</sup> Even in the United States, many cities wish to stay away from the Olympic bidding process. Most recently,<a href = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-27/boston-no-longer-u-s-candidate-for-2024-olympics-usoc-says> Boston’s citizens protested</a> the city government to ensure they would not bid for the 2024 Olympics. This year, Rio de Janeiro took the stage as the grand games’ host and has already shown the Olympic burden of hosting them.</p>
							<p>
							When Rio began the bidding process, it vowed to be ready to host. Despite its history, Brazil claimed it was experiencing a booming economy and had a prosperous future, <a href = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113493385> particularly in Rio </a>. This, coupled with the fact that no country in South America had ever hosted the Olympics, led to excitement in the region. In October of 2009, the IOC announced Rio would host the 2016 games, and its streets and beaches <a href = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/sports/03olympics.html?_r=0> immediately erupted in celebration</a>. Since then, however, Brazil and Rio have faced immense challenges. From a corrupt national government, to a recently weakened economy, to a brutal police force and violent gang behavior, Rio is likely to suffer more as the Olympics conclude.</p>
							<p>
							In terms of the political atmosphere in Brazil, it is not easygoing. The state-owned oil company Petrobras has been embroiled in a fierce corruption scandal for two years. Allegedly, politicians in the Workers’ Party and its cohorts <a href = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/6e8b0e28-f728-11e5-803c-d27c7117d132.html#axzz4H9OApkgp> illegally received funds from Petrobras</a> to fund their campaigns. In early 2016, President Dilma Rouseff, already suspected of corruption as director of Petrobras, <a href = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36028247>  was impeached due to government budget fraud</a>. Today, Brazil is still dealing with the fallout of this exposed corruption, and it has negatively affected the economy as well as the reputation it holds globally. Hosting the games has put Brazil’s scandals front and center.</p>
							<p>
							For the past three years, Brazil’s economy has contracted and doesn’t seem to have an optimistic future. Brazil’s top commodities are oil, sugar, and coffee, all of which have seen global prices drop, according to <a href = http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/03/news/economy/brazil-recession-lower-middle-class/> CNN Money</a>.  In conjunction with the aforementioned political corruption, this has led to <a href = http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/03/news/economy/brazil-recession-lower-middle-class/>  one of the worst recessions </a> in Brazilian history. When this recession began, the growing economy of Brazil, especially Rio, took a hit that led to many drawbacks regarding the Olympics. The funding for construction and revitalization projects was scarce. Plans to clean up the city’s streets, neighborhoods, and bodies of water were limited, and paying for extra security was a challenge.</p>
							<p>
							Now, costs for construction are estimated to be at $20 billion,<a href = http://www.cfr.org/brazil/economics-hosting-olympic-games/p38148> significantly overbudget </a>.  The bodies of water containing raw sewage are still not cleaned up, despite already hosting various events — in fact, the WHO has supplied athletes with <a href = http://www.circleofblue.org/2016/south-america/brazil-rio-sewage-one-many-water-challenges/> guidelines to avoid contamination and illness </a>. Furthermore, amidst the threat of Zika virus, many athletes withdrew from their events this year. Rio’s state budget crisis, an extension of the national recession, has led to <a href =http://www.cfr.org/brazil/economics-hosting-olympic-games/p38148> hospitals’ lack of medicinal resources and basic supplies</a>, let alone those needed to fight the negative effects of Zika virus. These particular economic strains are a direct result of hosting the Olympics. Rather than shelling out money and amassing large debts to host the games, Rio (and Brazil) should focus on repairing its damaged economy. The cost of hosting is likely to impact Rio and its people for years to come.</p>
							<p>
							Perhaps the biggest consequence of hosting the Olympics in Rio is safety. An estimated 85,000 security personnel were brought in for the Olympics, which called for a <a href = http://www.cfr.org/brazil/economics-hosting-olympic-games/p38148> government bailout</a> to ensure Rio could cover the cost, yet another extra expense. With security focused on the Olympics, the city’s slum neighborhoods, known as favelas, continue to spur extreme crime. For years, these favelas have been dominated by gang violence and drug wars, driving away investment and tourism. To combat this crime, Rio created the Pacifying Police Units to challenge the gangs. Rather than fix this problem, the <a href = http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/sunday/brazils-olympic-catastrophe.html?_r=0> militarized police and gangs wage war in the favelas</a>, and civilian causalities are inevitable.</p>
							<p>
							The risk of spillover into the games continues to be a real concern, as tourists are met with danger repeatedly. A journalist from the <a href =http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/sunday/brazils-olympic-catastrophe.html?_r=0> New York Times</a> writes that tourists have been mugged frequently alongside Copacabana and 76 people have been caught by stray bullets in 2016 alone. At the Olympics, to date, a <a href = http://www.newsweek.com/rio-2016-media-bus-attacked-high-crime-area-deodoro-488981>  media bus was attacked </a> on route to the main press area, <a href = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rio-olympics-security-increased-stray-918846>a stray bullet pierced a press tent</a>, and four USA swimmers, including Ryan Lochte, <a href = http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/14/sport/us-swimmers-ryan-lochte-robbed-rio-olympics/>were robbed at gunpoint</a>.</p>
							<p>
							Yet it is the people who live in Rio who suffer the most. The games have turned attention away from them and their safety. A <a href = http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/surge-in-killings-by-police-sparks-fear-in-favelas-100-days-ahead-of-rio-olympics> report by Amnesty International </a> finds that since 2014, homicides by police in Rio have increased 54 percent and are up 10 percent from this time last year. Additionally, the city’s homeless and impoverished were swept aside before the start of the games, often by force, and an <a href =  http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/opinion/sunday/brazils-olympic-catastrophe.html?_r=0>estimated 4,120 families were displaced</a> due to construction. Despite the fact that the Olympics was largely paid for with public funds, the <a href = http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-brazil-olympics-apathy-20160723-snap-story.html> LA Times</a> shares that Rio’s locals cannot afford or spare time to actually see any of the competitions.</p>
							<p>
							Although the global broadcasts of the Rio Olympics show the games going off without a hitch, aside from the <a href = http://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12417804/rio-olympics-2016-pool-green> green diving pool </a> or the <a href = (http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/25/sport/olympics-2016-rio-village-australia/> exposed wires in Olympic Village</a>, the true consequences of hosting are taking place behind the scenes. So far, Brazil’s government corruption was exposed to the world, an extensive price tag led to a massive debt and limited resources for construction and health, and human rights violations are driving Rio’s people into further poverty and dangerous situations. While the plight of the Olympics certainly affects all its hosts, Rio is case and point of the worst of the costs.</p>
							<p>
							While many have come forward to share their ideas on making the Olympics more host-friendly, no definite answer has come about. One popular resolution is to <a href = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/27/economists-think-its-a-terrible-idea-for-d-c-to-host-the-2024-olympics/>only allow cities who can foot the bill entirely</a> to host the games. Yet this would lead to exclusivity among host cities and leave out many places who could benefit from the games. Others say one city should be designated the <a href = http://time.com/4396796/olympic-host-city/> permanent host</a>, but again, this prevents other cities from having the opportunity to garner the world’s Olympic attention.</p>
							<p>
							Historically, the IOC pits cities against one another to compete for the Olympic bid — which city can produce the most lavish and extravagant Olympics plan? This practice is unsustainable and proof that the IOC needs to be reformed. Its current <a href = https://www.olympic.org/olympic-agenda-2020> Agenda 2020</a> outlines more progressive policies, including cutting bidding costs and adjusting the post-games function of Olympic infrastructure. Business Insider shared that the IOC was set to make <a href = http://www.businessinsider.com/finances-of-the-ioc-2012-8#> $8 billion in 2012</a>. Located in Switzerland, the IOC is tax-exempt and not subject to bribery laws. This has led to a large amount of money in the IOC’s hands. Furthermore, global sponsorships from corporations like NBC, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s have allowed the IOC to amass <a href = http://www.businessinsider.com/finances-of-the-ioc-2012-8#> exorbitant revenue</a>. However, only a small percentage of these funds make their way into a host city’s operational costs while the majority goes to organizing committees around the world that push for big Olympics bids.</p>
							<p>
							In order to fix what is known as the <a href = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/07/the-curse-of-the-olympics.html>  Olympic Curse,</a> major reforms from the IOC and participating nations are necessary. The IOC, with its mega wealth, should offer more funds to assist host cities and the hefty costs associated with the games. Additionally, a crowdfund from all nations who compete would come in handy for host cities struggling to pay.</p>
							<p>
							The games are meant to be a symbol of cooperation and international sportsmanship, and helping one another cover costs is just an extension of that principle. We all love the Olympics, and most people don’t want to see the day when they are no longer plausible. That being said, it’s time to focus on making the Olympics attainable for any city that wishes to host, and make it a blessing, not a burden.</p>
