									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span></p>
									
									<p>I’d like to start off by apologizing for the clickbait title, although it’s not entirely wrong. I unknowingly spent the last week of my life at a conservative Republican/Libertarian summer camp. Let me paint the picture: I’m a liberal vegetarian feminist who currently identifies as a democratic socialist after campaigning for America’s grandfather Bernie Sanders. </p>
									<p>Part of this was my fault for not identifying the red flags early on: the camp itself was called The Constitutional Academy, and it was hosted by the Bill of Rights Institute. Is that Libertarian enough for you?</p>
									<p>In my defense, I’m only 18 and hadn’t really had that much third-party exposure up to that point. Plus, I was sponsored so the camp was free and who doesn’t like free stuff? I arrived at the small, conservative Catholic university campus in Arlington on Sunday evening, and it took me until Tuesday afternoon to realize what I had gotten myself into.</p>
									<p>The first thing I’d learned was that they only recruited kids from red states (Florida, Texas, Utah, Kansas, etc.), then after countless conservative speakers and hints at the camp staff’s own views, realized the gravity of the situation. My week was less than halfway over, and my tolerance was wearing thin as my liberal heartbeat slowed. The only thing keeping me sane was my equally-as-liberal roommate who ranted with me about the day’s biases. </p>
									<p>I spoke with the director Wednesday night, wondering where all the Democratic representation was, and that if it was a biased camp, why didn’t he advertise it as such? He told me we had many blue speakers to come, and the reason it seemed biased was because some had cancelled last minute. It seemed reasonable enough, until the days passed and everything around me still emanated a bright tinge of red. We had a networking luncheon that consisted of only three Libertarian organizations and a Tea Party Republican group. Needless to say, I just stayed at my table. Even the representatives we met on our trip to the Capitol were all Republican; there was not one Democrat, not even for the sake of availability. The Republican asphyxiation was real.</p>
									<p>Here's what I learned: yes, I found a pocket of liberals that I clung to in the most trying of times (i.e. all of the debates), but I learned that I could make friends outside of party lines and not completely hate it. I know this isn’t a shocking revelation to most, but I’m still young and guilty of not separating the politics from the person.</p>
									<p>In fact, because of the camp’s bias, most of the friends I made were Republicans/Libertarians; and I lived to tell the tale. Sound the alarm! Elysse had a completely obvious breakthrough! We talked about ourselves, our personalities, our interests, our passions; I got to know them as people and not as young politicians. If someone said something particularly polarizing, we debated it, but could easily snap out of it for a friendly game of volleyball or a late-night ice cream run. Watching the current election and being able to participate for the first time created such a steep divide across party lines. I judged the book by its political affiliation. Had I carried that belief throughout the week, I would have missed out on some great friends. <span style = "font-style:italic">Sure they’re Republican</span>, but they’re being politically active! That’s huge for people my age, and admirable no matter who they’re supporting. </p>
									<p>So we don’t agree on everything, and I didn’t hold them accountable for it. I didn’t blame them or find it an unforgivable quality; I learned from them. I accepted and tolerated their beliefs. <span style = "font-style:italic">Wow! What a concept!</span> I even realized that I was trying to stay so rigid along party lines that I was compromising some of my beliefs because they didn’t fit the Democratic platform 100 percent. When did I start compromising my integrity? When did I become so judgmental? I was such a hypocrite!</p>
									<p>In summary, I learned: tolerance and acceptance aren’t rocket science, this election is dividing us into so many fractions that we forget our basic principles, and Coke Zero is not an adequate substitute for coffee.</p>
