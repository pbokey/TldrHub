							<p class="tldr">Police forces under the control of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte have killed nearly one thousand people in attempts to combat drug use. Human rights in the Philippines have become virtually invisible since the beginning of the drug war two months ago. Despite international intentions to intrude on the country’s sovereignty for humanitarian purposes, no legitimate actions have been successfully taken against the Philippine government so far. Duterte has broken international law and ignored human rights to combat drug crime. Crime does not excuse murder.</p>

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>Last week the Philippines made headlines for taking an incredibly direct approach to their domestic drug cartel problem — targeting drug traffickers with intentions to kill. Nearly one thousand Philippians have been killed in the past month over charges relating to drug trafficking. </p>
							<p>President Rodrigo Duterte has been criticized by his leading political enemy, the Communist Party of the Philippines, for abusing his powers and violating human rights. The Communist Party has also accused Duterte of not having legitimate evidence for many of his assassinations. In their <a href = http://www.cpp.ph/no-more-cooperation-with-dutertes-undemocratic-and-anti-people-drug-war/>address to the government</a> , the Communist Party states, “The drug problem has become worse. ... All democratic forces must unite and demand justice and an end to the madness of police and vigilante killings. They must unite to defend human rights.”</p>

							<p>
							Accordingly to the <a href = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3741589/Drug-dealers-Philippines-killed-streets-Manila.html> Daily Mail</a>, Duterte won in a landslide election, largely due to his pledge “to kill tens of thousands of criminals.” His election campaigns often included declaring that thousands will die in order to combat the war. His commitment to his cause has threatened international ties. Duterte has stated that he would pardon police if charged with human rights violations. The United States embassy has taken action to ensure that the Philippine’s military government adherences to international law.
							</p>

							<p>June 30th of this year marks beginning of the drug war, with more than five thousand arrested, 565,000 surrendered, and <a href = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-03/duterte-to-push-ahead-with-name-shame-in-drug-war-as-deaths-rise>at least 1,000 killed.</a></p>

							<p>Neither the extent of drug use nor the innocence of the dead has been questioned, making this governmental order a political genocide. Duterte has focused all of the nation’s security toward the war on drugs, leaving an open threat to other sorts of attacks. Many have called on the UN, China, and the United States to combat the Philippines’ government, but sadly all three have too weak relations with the nation to have much political direction, especially when the murders are technically covered by “unlawful practice.”</p>

							<blockquote cite= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/more-than-700-killed-in-less-than-three-months-in-filipino-drugs-crackdown>
							"We are calling on the UN drug control bodies to publicly condemn these atrocities in the Philippines. This senseless killing cannot be justified as a drug control measure." 
							</blockquote>
							<div class="citation">-Ann Fordham, Executive Director of the International Drug Police Consortium</div> 
							<br />

							<p> On the morality side of the issue, Leila de Lima, former Philippines justice minister and previous head of the nation’s human rights organization, has stated that innocent lives have also been killed under the shadow of the drug campaign. Not only are the legalities of drug use completely obliterated by Duterte’s drug war, but the lives of innocent people should not be harmed for the sake of the nation’s social values. If the government is murdering innocent people to preserve peace, then there is no government left in the Philippines truly for the people.</p>
							<p>International forces must stop the mass killings to preserve the human rights of all Philippians, despite drug usage. Although this tactic <a href = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/16/philippine-president-duterte-warns-terrorists-he-can-be-10-times-more-brutal-than-isis/>has created unruly fear</a> in the remaining drug cartels and lords, the destruction of justice and law is too far of a crime that can ever be excused by good intentions. </p>
							<p>To kill innocent lives and even guilt-ridden lives whose crimes can be eventually pardoned — and to have human rights completely obliterated into thin air — is when the government and the police have gone too far. </p>
