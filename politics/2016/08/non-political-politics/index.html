								<!-- Body of the Article -->
								<p>
								Politics are not my forte. I grew up in an environment that didn’t focus on politics and went years without knowing the basic, distinguishing differences between the Democratic and Republican parties. In my 7th grade civics class, I nervously asked which political party the elephant represented.
								</p>

								<p>
								While I’m still not “into” politics — reading up on governmental candidates and policies doesn’t fit into my repertoire of hobbies — I have a bit of a basic understanding about it, thanks to never-ending social media, my friends who actually know politics, and the handful of classes I’ve taken that touched on the subject. 
								</p>

								<p>
								Lucky for me, a lot of what I’ve seen from this year’s presidential election has focused heavily on social media. I might not understand the deep dark details of financial policy, but I sure can follow a Twitter war. This realization shocked me, as it seems like politics has lost a lot of what makes it just that — political — and has taken more of a social edge.
								</p>

								<p>
								Since I understand the social side of this election a bit more than the politics, let me explain the implications I’m seeing. 
								</p>

								<p>
								Most of what I know about Donald Trump is: he wants to build a wall, he has offended almost every non-white race there is, he looks like an orange Cheeto, and he recently used Pokemon Go (if you don’t know what this is, head to your friendly neighborhood park) as a campaign ad to slander Hillary Clinton. There’s simply no way to get around the fact that Trump’s social presence is majorly hateful and even childish.
								</p>

								<p>
								When it comes to Hillary Clinton, she seems to really be playing on the “first female president” idea. Outweighing that, however, seems to be her less-than-desirable situation with emails, as well as her tendency to desperately try to connect with younger voters (such as when she hopped on Snapchat and updated us saying she’s “Just chilling in Cedar Rapids”). Clinton’s social presence carries much less hate and immaturity than Trump’s and would signify historical progress if she wins. However, she too is imperfect and even questionable.
								</p>

								<p>
								This presidential election is turning America into a social laughing stock. The callow banter between Clinton and Trump — whether it be remarks such as “delete your account” or name calling such as “Crooked Hillary” — is making us look nothing short of incapable.
								</p>

								<p>
								The President of the United States of America is a reflection of our country to the rest of the world. We, as voters, should do everything in our power to keep that image one that proudly says that America is moving past its differences and healing together in the midst of hatred and tragedy. However, the 2016 election is causing me more and more to believe that this will be a difficult ideal to uphold; either candidate could reflect the United States poorly. This being said, we need to start holding our potential presidents to a higher standard of social etiquette in order to preserve the image and social power of our country.
								</p> 

								<p>
								This election is just as much about character as it is about policy. 
								</p>
