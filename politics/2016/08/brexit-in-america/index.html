									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p>

									<p>
									The world woke up on June 24 to news no one really understood: Britain left the European Union. The so-called “Brexit” baffled the political world, and the immediate global reaction to the referendum shocked the everyday citizen. <a href ="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/06/24/480949383/britains-google-searches-for-what-is-the-eu-spike-after-brexit-vote"> Many of the British people couldn’t even comprehend the consequences of their own vote — the number one Google search</a> among the British the day after the referendum was “What is the EU?” However, this referendum has led to more than just confusion. With the absence of Britain, the political and economic power of the EU on the global stage is set to take a hit. Trade deals and open border agreements that have been in effect for decades are likely to collapse, and collaboration on policy formation among European nations is uncertain. 
									</p>

									<p>
									Plus, there is no doubt that Britain itself will suffer. The British pound has already lost its value. <a href ="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/06/investing/ brexit-pound-drops/"> CNN Money</a> wrote that the pound slumped to its lowest point in more than 30 years. Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down, and Theresa May, the leader of the conservative party, <a href ="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/andrea-leadsom-quits-race-for-british-prime-minister-clearing-way-for-theresa-may/2016/07/11/3b7259df-fe04-4f92-93a0-27ffeb3a835b_story.html"> took his place without even being formally elected</a> . Yet, the worst of the consequences seen thus far in Britain is the increase in hate crimes and discrimination toward minorities and migrants from all over. <a href ="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/racism-hate-crimes-increase-brexit-eu-referendum-a7113091.html"> The National Police Chief’s Council reported that harassment and xenophobic actions have increased fivefold.</a>.
									</p>

									<p>
									I know what you’re thinking — Why should Americans care? While Europe is the main stage for this breakdown of relations, there is a different attitude towards Brexit in the United States. It’s an attitude that isn’t exactly, well, honorable. For Americans who actually know what Brexit is, jokes and humorous social media posts are the go-to reaction. <a href ="https://twitter.com/i/moments/746411404786204672S"> Personally, I really love the joke</a> about America’s “Original Brexit” after the Revolutionary War. Despite the comedy gold, Brexit has real consequences for Americans, and these must be met with the appropriate diplomatic actions.
									</p>

									<p>
									Almost instantly, Brexit caused an international economic shift. The stock market dropped points immediately, and the British pound lost value. On top of these issues, the U.S. faces strained free trade deals between Europe and Britain. <a href ="https://ustr.gov/ttip"> Currently, the U.S. and the EU are negotiating for increased free trade through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)</a> . With Britain outside the EU, the TTIP negotiation won’t include them. While the U.S. and Britain will certainly hammer out a new trade agreement, <a href ="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/broadway_17th/2016/07/so-what-does-brexit-mean-for-the-u-s.html?ana=e_du_pap&ed=2016-07-15&j=74908092&s=article_du&t=1468685270"> this will take time and could cause a lapse</a> in financial and capital flows.
									</p>

									<p>
									As a remedy to a potential recession, the U.S. must take action to begin new trade talks with Britain. The best pathway to do so would be for the U.S. to include Britain in the TTIP, but considering the British hostility towards the EU, this may not be possible. The U.S. must also make a strong push to finalize the TTIP, as Brexit could cause the deal to fall through <a href ="https://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/opinion/what-does-brexit-mean-for-ttip/"> </a>. In essence, a breakdown in TTIP talks strains transatlantic economic flows, and may negatively affect the global trade balance.
									</p>

									<p>
									As any American voter will say, the current political discourse in the U.S. is a hot mess, especially with the upcoming presidential election. The same type of discourse is what pushed British citizens to vote to leave the EU. Many believed their voices weren’t being heard at the EU level, even claiming they had no democratic representation in Europe. Furthermore, those who voted to leave wanted to “take back full control” of their borders, sealing them to ensure migrants and refugees were unable to come to Britain <a href ="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887"> </a>. The same rhetoric is very apparent in American politics, and has led to some questionable actions on behalf of far right groups and politicians.
									</p>

									<p>
									While the U.S. isn’t part of any supranational organization like the EU, what happened in Britain is a sign of reluctance towards international cooperation. It’s pertinent to ensure that the U.S. doesn’t fall victim to isolationist tactics and policy. In this time of global terrorism and security crises, there is more reason than ever to unite against injustices on an international platform. The U.S. and Britain share an immense intelligence alliance that allows them to crack down on possible acts of terror, and the stream of information supplied to all nations could be damaged without Britain’s connection to the EU, <a href ="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/politics/what-brexit-means-for-the-united-states/"> according to Rob Wainwright of Europol</a>.
									</p>

									<p>
									NATO is a strong military alliance that binds much of Europe and the U.S., <a href ="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-06-24/how-the-brexit-vote-could-impact-nato-and-defense-policy"> including Britain. With Brexit in mind, NATO must stay committed to fighting global threats and must not allow political turmoil to harm international security</a>. The U.S., as a leading nation of NATO, should adopt policies to keep the security cooperation of NATO members fair and prioritized.
									</p>

									<p>
									While the consequences of Brexit are still unfolding across the globe, that doesn’t mean immediate attention isn’t necessary. Britain is one of the U.S.’s strongest allies, and it is important to keep it that way, despite the complications of Brexit. It is the U.S.’s duty to step forward in this situation to ensure that international cooperation continues, for the sake of the economy and the safety of citizens. And as citizens, of any country, we shouldn’t make jokes or mock political issues, no matter how much we believe our “Brexit” was better.
									</p>

									<p>
									To encourage cooperation on the global level, we must stand in unity, fight for the rights we believe in, and be open to working alongside other nations. Yes, Britain is our ally, but we shouldn’t allow ourselves to make the same mistakes they did. 
									</p>
