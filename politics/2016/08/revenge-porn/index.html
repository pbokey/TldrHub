									<p class="tldr">Last October, Florida passed a law criminalizing revenge porn to prevent people from posting sexually-explicit images of others online. However, the law is too specific for many offenders to actually be convicted. Some argue this is a violation of free speech and makes it difficult to distinguish pornography from images of breastfeeding or nudity in textbooks. Others say it doesn’t suppress free speech because it protects victims from emotional distress, and the law is specific enough to exclude educational materials. Regardless, this controversial law and similar legislation will likely be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

								<!-- Body of the Article -->
								<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span><a href = "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.049.html">Section 784.049</a> of the Florida Statutes, entitled “sexual cyberharassment,” went into effect on October 15, 2015. The statute criminalizes publishing “revenge porn,” making Florida one of many states with <a href = "http://www.cybercivilrights.org/revenge-porn-laws/"> similar laws.</a></p>
								<p><span style = "font-style:italic";>Crapps v. State</span> (Fla. 1st DCA 2015) noted that Florida now has an additional tool to prosecute acts of so-called “revenge porn” or “sexual cyberharassment” because section 784.049, Florida Statutes, specifically prohibits the publication of sexually-explicit images of a person on the Internet without his or her consent.</p>
								<p>“Sexually cyberharass” means to publish a sexually explicit image of a person that contains or conveys the personal identification information of the depicted person to an Internet website without the depicted person’s consent, for no legitimate purpose, with the intent of causing substantial emotional distress to the depicted person. “Sexually explicit image” means any image depicting nudity, or depicting a person engaging in sexual conduct. (“Nudity” and “sexual conduct” are defined in s. <a href = "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=784.049&URL=0800-0899/0847/Sections/0847.001.html">847.001</a>, Florida Statutes.)</p>
								<p>The Florida House of Representatives <a href = "http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=h0151z1.CRJS.DOCX&DocumentType=Analysis&BillNumber=0151&Session=2015">Final Bill Analysis</a> cited a <a href = "http://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2013/q1/20130204-01.aspx">McAfee survey </a> conducted in 2012, which found that one in ten ex-partners have threatened to expose risqué photos online, and that these threats were carried out nearly 60 percent of the time. In response to this trend, the Legislature found that “a person depicted in a sexually explicit image taken with the person’s consent has a reasonable expectation that the image will remain private” and that “safeguarding the psychological well-being of persons depicted in such images is compelling.” In addition to the criminal penalties, the statute provides for civil remedies, including injunctive relief and monetary damages.</p>
								<p>The statute started with <a href = "https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2015/0538/BillText/Filed/PDF">Senate Bill 538</a>, which had a broader reach and harsher penalties than the amended <a href = "http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h0151c1.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=0151&Session=2015">Bill 151</a> that passed in the House. The Senate Bill didn’t require personal identification information if the depicted person’s face was recognizable, and covered disclosure by any electronic medium, instead of just publication to an internet website. The penalty for violating the statute was a felony of the third degree, instead of a misdemeanor. <a href = "http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_s1414__.DOCX&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=1414&Session=2016">Senate Bill 1414</a>, with updated language for Section 784.049, died in committee in March of 2016.</p>
								<p>The House’s changes to the Senate Bill highlight some of the problems with Section 784.049 –there are many situations in which someone who publishes revenge porn couldn’t be convicted under the statute. While risk associated with publishing revenge porn was established through this law, there is still substantial risk associated with a person depicted in a sexually explicit image allowing someone else to possess that image, with little certainty given to who will actually suffer consequences.<p>
								<p><strong>Potential Consequences for Perpetrators of Revenge Porn:</strong></p>
								<p>A person who willfully and maliciously sexually cyberharasses another person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable by up to one year of imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Subsequent violators commit a felony of the third degree, punishable by up to five years of imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. Penalties for Section 784.049 are provided in  s. <a href = "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.082.html">775.082 </a>, s. <a href = "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.083.html">775.083</a>, and s. <a href = "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.084.html">775.084</a>.</p>
								<p>Some employers and <a href = "http://www.communityalternatives.org/pdf/Reconsidered-criminal-hist-recs-in-college-admissions.pdf">most college applications</a> ask about criminal convictions, so arrests or convictions for sexual cyberharassment could have a negative impact even beyond the statutory penalties for committing a misdemeanor or felony.</p>
								<p>While the constitutionality of revenge porn laws has been questioned, appealing a conviction could take years and cost thousands of dollars.</p>
								<p><strong> Uncertainties </strong></p>
								<p>Since the penalties for those who publish revenge porn are by no means guaranteed, some people will probably still post revenge porn online. This means that sharing sexually explicit photos still carries substantial risk for anyone depicted, because the pictures could become widespread through legal means.</p>
								<p>It will be fairly difficult to actually convict someone or win civil action under this statute. The statute only covers publications to an internet website, not necessarily sending photos through messaging sites. The photos must also be accompanied with personal identification information, such as a name or an email address, for their publication to be punishable. Proving that the images were published without the consent of the depicted person, for no legitimate purpose (a vague requirement), and with the intent of causing substantial emotional distress beyond a reasonable doubt will be difficult at trial.</p>
								<p><strong>The Questionable Constitutionality of Florida’s Revenge Porn Law:</strong></p>
								<p>Furthermore, convictions under this law could be overturned in the appellate courts if the law is found to be unconstitutional. Section 784.049 was considered at the 2016 high school moot court competition put on by the <a href = "http://www.flrea.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=35&Itemid=30">Florida Law Related Education Association</a>. The competition addressed whether the statute violated the right to freedom of speech, and arguments were judged at the state level by First District Court of Appeal Judges and the Florida Supreme Court Justices.</p>
								<p>If the law is actually appealed, the courts might not find that protecting the psychological well-being of persons depicted in sexually explicit images is a valid state interest, especially because it seems to be so easy to blame the victims of sexual cyberharassment. Numerous attorneys, judges, and justices who considered the constitutionality of the law for the moot court competition raised the same point when discussing the need to protect victims: she let him have the pictures.</p>
								<p>After the final round, Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente noted that the Florida Legislature passes sometimes constitutionally questionable laws, expecting the courts to overturn them if they aren’t constitutionally sound. However, expecting the courts to review every law passed in Florida is impractical. The <a href = "http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=h0151z1.CRJS.DOCX&DocumentType=Analysis&BillNumber=0151&Session=2015">House Bill Analysis</a> even recognized that revenge porn laws might fail in appellate courts, stating that “because such statutes restrict speech, they raise constitutional concerns.” </p>
								<p>Expressive conduct, such as flag burning, is protected by the First Amendment, as established in <span style = "font-style:italic";>Texas v. Johnson</span> (1989). Even so, “while the First Amendment generally prohibits the Government from restricting speech based on its message or viewpoint… the First Amendment’s free-speech protections are not absolute,” as stated in <span style = "font-style:italic";>United States v. Martinez</span> (11th Cir. 2013). There are certain categories of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, such as obscenity and fighting words. It has been argued that Florida’s sexual cyberharassment law doesn’t restrict protected speech because the law limits obscenity. However, <span style = "font-style:italic";> Miller v. California </span> (1973) established a test to determine if material constitutes obscenity, and because images depicting nudity or sexual conduct aren’t necessarily obscene, Florida’s sexual cyberharassment law doesn’t just restrict obscenity.</p>
								<p>While the obscenity exception is not sufficient, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the idea that the First Amendment does not protect words that “by their very utterance inflict injury,” in the words of <span style = "font-style:italic";> Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire </span> (1942). <span style = "font-style:italic";> Martinez </span> noted that true threats fall under this category of unprotected speech, “inflicting injury on the listener by their very utterance.” <span style = "font-style:italic";> Martinez </span> also established the validity of protecting individuals from psychological harm, specifically “the fear of violence and the disruption that fear engenders.”</p>
								<p>Hypotheticals are often raised to show the unconstitutional reach of revenge porn laws, with critics stating that the laws will allow the convictions of individuals who share images of breastfeeding mothers or who publish images containing nudity in history books. Florida’s sexual cyberharassment law, however, wouldn’t be able to punish these publications. Florida has clearly specified in <a href = "http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=784.049&URL=0800-0899/0847/Sections/0847.001.html">section 847.001</a>, Florida Statutes, that “a mother’s breastfeeding of her baby does not under any circumstance constitute ‘nudity’.” Additionally, it would be very difficult to successfully argue that an image in a history book was maliciously published, for no legitimate purpose, with the intent of causing substantial emotional distress to the depicted person.</p>
								<p> The United States Supreme Court will likely consider the issue of regulating revenge porn in the future, since so many states have passed a revenge porn law in some form. </p>
