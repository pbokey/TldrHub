The Democratic Alliance has gained increasing control, ensuring that the new political party will have representation in the government. South Africa has not only created plurality in their single dominant party system, but has endorsed a temporary end to the nation’s notorious racial politics. As one of the most corrupt and unequal nations in the world, the future of South Africa not only holds control of its own, but its influence over all of Africa. </p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 0">The African National Congress Monopoly Collapse</h3>
							
							<p>
							1994 marked the year Nelson Mandela became South Africa’s first democratic president after decades of white minority control over the nation. Mandela became a man of remarkable diplomacy, economic development, and social order in both the nation and continent of Africa. The African National Congress (ANC) was the first political party in South Africa under the power of Mandela himself. The ANC earned respect and praise for being “Mandela’s party,” uplifting the nation’s prestige after the destruction of Apartheid. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							However, after twenty-two years of monolithic control, the ANC has gained a reputation of bureaucratic corruption and political scandal that has halted the developing nation from democratic potential and economic growth. Since 2008, South Africa has had one of the worst cases of economic inequality in the world with little political enforcement to change this. 
							</p>
							
							<p>The political party – famous for the man that embraced equality and diversity – has become notorious for inequality and political dishonesty upon Mandela’s departure. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The South African President, Jacob Zuma, has tarnished the ANC’s reputation beyond recovery. As of last spring the ANC supported Zuma in court after evidence of him disregarding constitutional regulations by not repaying millions of taxpayer dollars that were spent on rebuilding his own private estate, <a href = "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2eba0d32-5c8e-11e6-a72a-bd4bf1198c63.html#axzz4GfpkWOxL">infuriating South Africans</a> during times of economic hardships. The corruption and scandals of Zuma have destroyed the approval rating of the ANC and has sparked an intruding desire for Zuma’s resignation.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							2016 became the year a second political party named the Democratic Alliance (DA) won a local election in Pretoria after years in unsupported political activism, the executive capitol of South Africa (the country has three capitols). Following the capital was the municipality of Nelson Mandela Bay, renowned for its fight against Apartheid in the twentieth century. The African National Congress still holds a majority at 54% of the national vote, but the Democratic Alliance follows in rising numbers at 27%, the largest amount of control any political party has had in South Africa besides the ANC. Following the Democratic Alliance is a smaller party called the <a href = "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36997461">Economic Freedom Fighters</a>, with a national vote at eight percent. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The new success of the Democratic Alliance in large cities such as Pretoria and Johannesburg requires compromise between the party and the ANC.  This coalition would mean changes to the economic recession and tarnished government. This would be the first time since the end of Apartheid where the South African government would be obliged to cooperate with a minor political party. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>Importance to the World</h3>
							
							<p>
							As Nelson Mandela’s party, importance of cultural and racial identity needs to be accepted by a nation stricken with historic discrimination and inequality.  
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Until May of 2015, the leader of the Democratic Alliance was a white female named Helen Zille. Despite being a former antiapartheid activist and the 2008 World Mayor of the Year for her work in Cape Town, the presence of <a href = "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/baaskap">baaskap</a> led the party to limited success for her time in office.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The Apartheid term defining the control by white people of non-white people led the majority of voters and activists to the dismay of the party. A party that has been considered “white” for years has finally undergone the favor of Africans, <a href = "http://www.southafrica.info/about/people/population.htm#.V6kU_PkrLIU">who comprise almost 80%</a> of the national population. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The possessive nature of a party to a beloved leader is reflected in United States history, where the Republican Party is often considered “the Party of Lincoln.” However, as recent as the 2016 elections the Democratic Party has insisted to African Americans that their progressive approach to civil rights has become much more exponential than the GOP. South Africans’ desire for progressive equality can only be succeeded by either removing the corruption of the ANC or transitioning to the Democratic Alliance, which appears to be a possible approach for Republican African Americans in the United States. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The victory of the Democratic Alliance can also lead as an innovative ideal of plurality and democratic achievement across the entire world. South Africa is considered the beacon of democracy and development to other African nations, and the rise of plurality can inevitably lead to greater acceptance of a second political party throughout the entire continent. The ANC’s notorious xenophobia exemplified by Jacob Zuma has a chance of being smoothened by a party that recognizes the importance of all cultures and ethnicities. 
							</p>

							<p>
							If you don’t care about South African government or the elimination of racial politics, then consider South Africa foreign policy’s importance to nearly fifty developing nations.
