Trump’s xenophobic statements and policies reflect his lack of qualifications for the presidency. Clinton’s policies align with Bernie’s, and a Republican supermajority would undo the progress under the Obama Administration. A third-party candidate such a Jill Stein would not win. Clinton may not create a political revolution, but she would add to current progress. We must unify as a party to defeat Donald Trump. We must put aside idealism for pragmatism. </p>

									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>I’m voting for Secretary Hilary Clinton. As a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders, those lines used to be near sacrilege. Following his recent endorsement, however, this idea isn’t really that farfetched.</p>
									<p>
									The main reason to do this of course is to prevent Donald Trump from becoming the president. Besides all that has been said about him already, including his blatant racism and overall unqualified nature, this would have even worse ramifications. A Trump presidency would lead to a Republican supermajority in the branches of government. This means that they would pass every single piece of legislation they want, and they would get rid of policies the Obama Administration put in place. Trump could also hurt us even more by putting in Supreme Court justices whose conservative rulings would haunt us for years to come.</p>
									<p>
									Understandably, a decent portion of Sanders’ supporters would rather vote for Dr. Jill Stein, third-party candidate whose morals align more with Sanders. This vote, however, will likely go to waste. The United States works around a bias toward a two-party system, and this election won’t change that. In fact, in the history of the US, no third-party candidate has won since 1860. America’s households likely don’t know who the third-party candidates even are. A vote for them would, in essence, be a vote for Trump because Clinton isn’t getting the votes to oppose him.</p>
									<p>
									Overall, Clinton is still a Democrat. This immediately puts her above Trump and his party of conservatives. Her policies are still liberal, and although she has changed viewpoints, they have changed for the better. The lasting effect she will have on this country would be eons better than the turmoil Trump will cause. You may not trust her, and truthfully I feel the same way, but as of now we need to think practically. Clinton is the best and most viable option we have in this election.</p>
									<p>
									Before you vote, just ask yourself a question: Is a nation controlled by Clinton really as bad as one controlled by Trump?
