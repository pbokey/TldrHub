									<p class="tldr">Paul Ryan has become both an inspiration and a role model for politicians and the general public. Finding politicians with both integrity and honesty is so rare that Ryan is a breath of fresh air to many who are tired of the corruption in Washington. Paul Ryan has become a unifying face of the Republican party while reflecting bravery, family values, and being a  prime example of a public servant who not only serves but understands the common people.</p>

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p><span class="city">Washington, DC.</span> Picture an awkward fifteen-year-old aimlessly walking the halls of the Capitol with a freshly-printed intern ID and enough enthusiasm to seriously scare someone. Somewhere along the way she met her hero — Wisconsin's 1st District Congressman Paul Ryan. That girl was me, and it was probably the best day of my life.
 
							My love for Speaker Ryan is sharper than his chiseled physique. In a current political world where it's hard to find genuine politicians to look up to (can genuine and politicians even be used in the same sentence anymore?), Speaker Ryan gives me hope for the future, as someone who actually wants compromise and is willing to work to get America on “The Way Forward.” If you are not totally a Ryan-er by now, I want to leave you with my top five favorite things about Paul: 
							<ol>
							<li>Not afraid of confrontation - The perfect example of this was back in 2012 when Ryan blasted IRS Commissioner John Koskinen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzpZjHlgxO4] for not being honest. No words were held back.</li>

							<li>A family guy - Before Ryan agreed to run for Speaker of the House, he made clear he would only do so if the family-to-work proportion was reasonable. He was unwilling to compromise time with his kids for time in the Speaker’s office. What rare words to come from a male politician’s mouth.</li>

							<li>Unifier -  Speaker Ryan worked to unify Republicans, serving as a steady hand for the party to turn to in our current political state. He was a voice of reason amongst the chaos.</li>

							<li>Hometown hero - Nothing warmed America's heart (or my heart) like Speaker Ryan's interview on 60 minutes [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-60-minutes/], which aired November 15th 2015. In the interview, Ryan revealed that he only lived in Janesville, Wisconsin; when he had to work in DC, he would sleep on a cot in his office. Efficient and devoted, classic Paul.</li>

							<li>Kept it hot in Cleveland – On July 19th, 2016, Ryan spoke at the Republican National Convention and offered these bold words: “In America, everyone has a place. No one is written off. Straight from the Declaration of Independence, that is the real Republican ideal.” A call to action from a true American leader.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
							Whether he is being a husband, father, Packer fan, or the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan is always on his “A” game.
