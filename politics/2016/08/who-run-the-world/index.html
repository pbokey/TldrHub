Despite all our achievements, until now a woman has never been chosen by a major party to run for the presidency. We’ve made great progress but still have a long way to go. Misogyny quickly ensued with too many men telling our next president to “lower her voice” and “smile.” Being a woman myself, I’ve experienced this as well while discussing politics, I can only hope that her presidency will change this.</p>

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>
							I have always been a feminist. Throughout my budding interest in politics, I knew it would be hard to move up the ladder in my career. I knew that no matter how high I thought I’d climbed, the glass ceiling was waiting to halt my ambitions and stand in the way of progress. But now, as of July 28, 2016, we’ve cracked it hard enough to shatter it. I’m sure there will still be struggles in the ways of equality, given that when Hillary Clinton won enough delegates to claim the nomination many major newspapers put her husband on the front instead. But in this moment I feel so empowered, I feel as though anything is possible, I feel like making snow angels with the shards of the glass ceiling we just shattered.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							However, I still constantly have adult men apologize for discussing politics in front of “the lady” despite the fact that I am of legal voting age and interested in a career in politics.
							</p>
 
							<p>
							It has taken us 44 tries to get it right, and I don’t want to wait through a 45th (especially since there’s no guarantee the world will survive after that 45th). I just want my friends, my daughters, my granddaughters, and every woman in America to see what they can accomplish. Scratch that – I want every woman in the world to realize their full potential. This is what I was born to see. I was put on this earth to hear the words “Madame President” in my lifetime.
							</p>

							<p>
							I was in an empowered high after Clinton’s acceptance speech on the final day of the Democratic National Convention, but it quickly faded the next morning when I saw too many tweets by men telling our next president to “lower her voice” and “smile.” Each “smile” tweet made me physically cringe. I’m sure this won’t be the end of it — I’ll likely endure many acts of sexist disrespect throughout her tenure — but I remain strong. To quote the former secretary herself: “when there’s no ceiling, the sky’s the limit.” So girls: be loud, be in charge, challenge people, dream big, raise your voice, run for office, change the rules, and believe in yourself; just look at what happens when you do.
