									<p class="tldr">Party politics has divided us as a nation. We’ve strayed from the vision of George Washington, who employed a split cabinet so all opinions could be heard. Partisanship has permeated our media, and moderate candidates have become rare. Political parties have their place — allowing like-minded individuals to come together and to voice their opinions — but they have made us lazy and forced us to not even consider the stances of a different party. Big money in politics has made politicians slaves to extreme party ideology and lobbyists. We must focus on bipartisan issues to create a stronger, more “united” America.

								<!-- Body of the Article -->
								<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>
								<strong>Republican. Democrat. Conservative. Moderate. Liberal. Redneck. Tree-hugger.</strong></p>
								<p>These are the labels we so often migrate toward when confronted with someone of a different opinion, causing us to become more and more separated as a nation. What was once a united and civil union has become nothing more than a battle of the “Blues” versus the “Reds.” It’s a shame. In the beginning, we were much more than pity politics.</p>

								<p>Yes, we were members of a party, but our loyalty was to our country. We were first led by arguably our greatest president, George Washington, a man who set in motion many of the precedents that we now follow today. Many of which I wish we hadn't lost.</p>
								<p>First of his precedents was the establishment of a Cabinet stocked with the most courageous and brilliant young leaders of his time, and, when analyzed closer, the idea of a Cabinet split across “party lines” was ingenious. He appointed Thomas Jefferson as the Secretary of State and Alexander Hamilton as the Secretary of Treasury. Thomas Jefferson was a loyal Democratic-Republican Party member, while Alexander Hamilton was a loyal member of the Federalist Party. Heck, Washington himself was an Independent! Washington supported innovative fiscal concepts such as the Bank of America and a national debt. He set the precedent for a two term limit for Presidents that was followed until the FDR era (then later turned into the 22nd Amendment), and he established the tradition of a Presidential farewell address.</p>
								<p><strong>Now, why do I bring all this up? After all, isn’t it irrelevant to our times now?</strong></p>
								<p>On the contrary, it’s possibly one of the most essential and understated pieces of our democratic system where we have lost our way. It’s easier to debate a policy if a President picks a Cabinet and Vice President that’s of the same party because there would be little-to-no discourse. Looking back at what good ol’ George was doing seems to make a lot of sense now, especially in today's 2D politics. Having a diverse and bipartisan Cabinet meant that he heard all opinions, positive and negative, of an issue and the resulting policy directive before it was proposed.</p> 
								<p>Wouldn’t it make sense to continue to have the President hear the opinions of the peoples’ parties and represent ALL the people of America instead of just his/her party? Crazy. I know.</p>
								<p>Today, our party lines have become so partisan and extreme that having a “common sense” or a “moderate” candidate to represent the silent majority of those who sit outside party lines seems absolutely absurd. It seems that even making friends or talking with family members who are of a different party is almost impossible. It’s difficult to name just one TV station or radio show that caters to the middle of the two extremes, not leaning one way or the other. Our party lines and their policies have defined and divided us.</p> 
								<p><strong>Today, it’s hard not to know a party’s key principles:</strong></p> 
								<p>Republican: Large Military, Limited Government, Lower Taxes, Pro-2nd Amendment, Pro-Life…</p>
								<p>Democratic: Small Military, Governmental Intervention, Higher Taxes, Gun Control, Pro-Choice…</p>
								<p>Now if you belong to either of these parties, you more than likely agree with at least three of the political principles I’ve described. And don’t get me wrong, that makes sense when you look at the purpose of our parties; they primarily function to allow us to vote for people who are like-minded and represent our ideals and values.</p>
								<p>However, over time this “surface level” line of thinking has done nothing but make us lazy, uninformed, and dependent on others to tell us what to believe. Instead of evaluating all opinions and hearing out all candidates, many just assume, “Ugh! They’re not from my party; I’ll never agree with them!” which is truly absurd. Many just TRUST that those in the limelight or those media ‘experts’ know what they are talking about and assume it’s logical. Not everything that is said on MSNBC, Fox News, or from party leaders is true. Unfortunately, many never follow through with the most important part of becoming a well-educated, well-meaning, objective participant in the political arena: verifying the positions and statements of others and formulating an opinion on what’s best for the country regardless of party lines.</p> <p><strong>We should, as Ronald Reagan once said, ‘Trust, but verify.’ </strong></p>
								<p>Regrettably, many of the individuals and lobbyists who support the candidates running for office are and represent extreme party ideals. Campaigns cost money—lots of money—and lobbyists and companies have lots of money to give to candidates that support their views. Our political system is virtually rigged to the point where only a self-funded candidate can enjoy the independence to run on a platform free from party extremism. But many of the party’s principles don’t represent the majority of our country. If they did, we wouldn’t have the crazed political cycle that we do, nor the civil unrest that we see in our nation today. </p>
								<p>Regardless of political affiliation, all Americans, as a vital piece of our electoral process, need to start thinking for themselves. While some Americans already do their homework, I encourage you to go the extra mile and dive into an opposing party’s politics, news channels, and discussions, and try to understand why others believe in what they do.</p> 
								<p>Aristotle once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it,” and I truly believe that if the whole of our country bought into this idea, we would be a united people instead of a divided one.</p>
								<p>All I wish is that we go back to a time when a party didn't define you. Where splitting a ticket among party affiliation wasn’t shunned, but encouraged. Where you could reach across the aisle and fight a battle that needed to be won, despite political differences. We should recognize the problems that both parties can agree need to be fixed, and then fix them by putting aside our self-interest and egos. Environmental stewardship, energy independence, fiscal responsibility, the fight against terrorism, and the push for a better education system are all fights that we as Americans should unite behind. </p>
								<p>The day we put aside our petty disagreements and are willing to accept the importance of bipartisanship, we will see a brighter, stronger, thriving, and UNITED States of America.</p>
