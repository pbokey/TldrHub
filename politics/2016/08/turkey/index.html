									<p class="tldr">In the wake of a failed military coup in Turkey, there’s been little mention by the media of all the major political players involved and the inevitability of the coup based on Turkey’s history. The military was viewed by the founder of Turkey, Ataturk, as a force of intervention in the event the government becomes too corrupt or Islamic. Four military coups have been conducted in the past. Motivations for this recent coup stem from dictatorial autocratic actions made by President Erdogan. Erdogan blames the attack on Fethullah Gulen, an influential imam and an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy.</p>

									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>I woke up on the 15th, checked BBC on my phone, and was disappointed to see nothing going on. I’m in my car, on the way to work, and then suddenly I get a push notification from BBC: “Apparent coup underway in Turkey. Low flying F-16 over Ankara.” My genuine first reaction was, “Oh, HELL YEAH.”</p>
									<p>
									I found myself explicitly supporting the violent overthrow of a democratically elected government. A government that my country (reluctantly) supports. But I didn’t care. I despise Erdogan and have even told co-workers and friends (and Reddit) that the only way the dictatorial autocratic Erdogan would give up power would be through a popular uprising or through a violent military coup. As I watched CNN and BBC, I was amazed by the limited knowledge people possessed on Turkey’s government and its history. It was saddening how little the anchors mentioned about the political dynamic and the different players involved in the coup.</p>
									<p>
									The live broadcasts were peppered with throwaway mentions of Turkey’s turbulent relationship between the government and its infallible military. Nobody seemed to mention Turkey’s infamous supremacist Grey Wolves, even while members blatantly threw out their hand signs while attacking military vehicles and ‘demonstrating’ in the streets. 
									Commentators seemed genuinely shocked by the events unfolding, which was surprising, as I would have thought anybody who followed Turkey’s history could have seen this coming from miles away.</p>
									<p>
									If you go through every past coup attempt, you’ll see a pattern. It’s a pattern of the government becoming too Islamist or too powerful and undermining democratic and secularist values, followed by the military coming in (usually to the great relief of the Turkish population) and pressing the ‘reset’ button, if you will. 
									Turkey is fascinating in the sense that there is a law in the books passed in 1961 that, under certain interpretations, allows the military to come in and seize power if they feel democracy is under threat. Inner Service Act of the Turkish Armed Forces (Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri İç Hizmet Kanunu) articles 35 and 85 allow (with some debate) the military to initiate a purge of sorts if they feel that the Kemalist ideology, the state ideology of secularism and democracy, is under direct threat.</p>
									<p>
									The military is perceived in Turkey as the direct successor of Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. In Turkey, Ataturk is almost deified, a modest figure who wanted only the best for the Turkish people. Being a military officer, he rebuilt the prestige of the Turkish Armed Forces after their humiliation during the First World War. He seized the spirit of the Ottomans and united a fractured people with no faith or pride in their country, and galvanized them into a new republican nation. This nation was based on freedom for all and protected by a military that is above the petty squabbles of the lowly, invariably corrupt politicians.</p>
									<p>
									Ataturk made it clear that it is the military who are the guardians of the heart and health of the nation. Ataturk would have it no other way. In the past 4 successful coups, the military councils formed to govern the nation would invoke the name of Ataturk and the Inner Service Act to justify their technically illegal seizures of government. Even as recently as 2007, when notorious Islamist leader, Abdullah Gul, ran for president of Turkey, the Turkish Armed Forces put out a statement warning that “the Turkish Armed Forces maintain their sound determination to carry out their duties stemming from laws to protect the unchangeable characteristics of the Republic of Turkey. Their loyalty to this determination is absolute.” In the same statement, they proclaimed themselves the apolitical arbitrators between the secularists and Islamists, and that their sole duty was to uphold secular Turkish values.</p>
									<p>
									Coups are synonymous with Turkey. We should have seen this coming. Why? 
									Let’s look at Erdogan and why, in my opinion, he needed to go. When you look at some of the things Erdogan has done, you may wonder why this didn’t happen sooner. Although striving to become a member of the European Union (EU) — one of the main platforms of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) was Turkey’s admission to the EU — Turkey has policies instituted by Erdogan that fundamentally conflict with what we would call “European Values.” 
									As of now, 7,000 have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the latest coup. Among those 7,000, photographs have surfaced of prisoners being stripped and taken to horse stables for added humiliation.</p>
									<p>
									Amnesty International has reported flagrant violations of human rights, including mass beatings, rapes, and possible killings. It seems as though admission to the EU isn’t a priority for Erdogan. This should be expected from a man whose country, in 2006, was ranked 154 out of 170 countries in press freedom by Reporters Without Borders. A man who also in 2014 directly challenged secularists and modernists in the military by stating, on International Women’s Day no less, “You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different…Our religion [Islam] has defined a position for women [in society]: motherhood. You cannot explain this to feminists because they don’t accept the concept of motherhood."</p>
									<p>
									Erdogan placed a majority of the blame on Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of his, now in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen, a very influential imam, is an ardent supporter of Turkish democracy, interfaith dialogue, and overall democratic tolerance between the warring political parties in Turkey: Turks and Kurds.</p>
									<p>
									He was a staunch ally of Erdogan until 2013, when a massive “oil for food” scandal rocked the Turkish government. Tapes were leaked of government officials engaged in a massive conspiracy with Iran in order to acquire more wealth through trading oil for food. 
									Erdogan suspected Gulen had something to do with the leak and vowed revenge against the Islamic community for leaking the tapes. Gulen realized he needed to leave and ended up under US protection in Pennsylvania. He remained mostly silent until the coup occurred and journalists were begging for his response. Gulen strongly denied taking part in the organization and execution of the coup. There is no evidence that he had any involvement in the coup. He even went so far as to strongly condemn the coup plotters for attempting to subvert a democratically elected government.</p>
									<p>
									Yet this does not stop Erdogan from claiming unequivocally that Gulen, an ‘enemy of democracy’, intends to destroy the Turkish Republic. Erdogan habitually blames ‘outside forces’ for any wrongdoing that occurs in Turkey. In my opinion, he seems to have taken the North Korean line when it comes to asserting blame for every problem that Turkey faces. The famous ‘this is not my government’s fault, absolutely not my fault, everybody is out trying to get us and destroy this extraordinary nation, everybody is against us so we must unite and fight back” seems to be Erdogan’s go-to excuse.</p>
									<p>
									The AKP, Erdogan’s ruling party, holds a parliamentary majority. This, in combination with Erdogan’s iron will, is a recipe for the abuse of human rights. He is your typical ‘strongman’.</p>
									<p>
									Since he first took office, he has begun a gradual, insidious campaign of suppression and censorship. Opposition media offices have been raided, some have been shut down. That was pre-coup. Now with the 3-month State of Emergency order, and he is now ruling by decree. Over 30,000 civil servants have been suspended indefinitely—even airline pilots and flight attendants working for Turkey’s national airline.</p>
									<p>
									It appears to many experts that Erdogan has used the coup as a Casus Bellum (a cause for war) in order to suppress all opposition and finally cement his rule as the leader of the Turkish Republic.</p>
									<p>
									Human Rights Watch in particular has been keeping a very close eye on the post-coup events in Turkey and has noted a sharp rise in seemingly arbitrary arrests under the auspices of protecting the nation. In my opinion, this will only get worse. So far Erdogan has abolished all military academies over fears that cadets are loyal to Gulen in lieu of Turkey. He has also fired his chief military executive over suspicions of his true loyalties. Erdogan is purging his entire armed forces over this incident.</p>
									<p>
									Here is why you should be worried. Turkey is currently engaged in two wars: against Kurdish separatists in the south and the war against the IS in Syria. Turkey is on the Syrian border and Erdogan has been a decent partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by allowing NATO aircraft to be based out of the Incirlik Air Base.</p>
									<p>
									However, as there were tankers refueling pro-coup military aircraft out of that base, the power was shut off. US forces stationed there raised the security level to DELTA, the highest level, and US planes were prohibited from conducting airstrikes on IS targets for a period of time. This not only endangered NATO forces stationed at the base, it also hampered the NATO effort to prosecute the war against IS.</p>
									<p>
									Relying heavily on Turkey as an ally, the US military trusted former Turkish commanders and maintained excellent relations with them. But with the restructuring of the Turkish military, with 7 000 soldiers and officers arrested, with the General in command of Incirlik air base being one of them, chaos and suspicion seem to reign within the Turkish military.</p>
									<p>
									This interferes with Turkey’s efforts and commitment to NATO’s war against the IS. We don’t know who the new commanders will be, what their temperaments will be, etc. Erdogan will likely replace the seasoned commanders with exceptionally loyal lapdogs who may not have the same pragmatism or skill as their predecessors, who are now incarcerated.</p>
									<p>
									Erdogan is also attempting to dramatically restructure the armed forces by modelling his military command structure after that of the US. He is doing this by integrating the previously separate, apolitical military establishment with his government by giving civilian government officials the final say in future military operations. While this works in the US, this system will most likely cause rifts and operational mistakes in Turkey, as any military decision by the generals must be politically beneficial for the AKP.</p>
									<p>What’s next for Turkey? Time will tell.</p>
									<p>Erdogan can very easily extend the state of emergency by continuing the mass arrests and seemingly arbitrary arrests of civilian protestors, the widespread suppression of popular dissent and opposition press, the tacit approval for his rabid Grey Wolves to harass and beat alleged coup supporters and participants with no fear of prosecution, and the purges of civil servants whom the AKP deem to have connections to Gulen.</p>
									<p>
									Or, he could learn from this. He could learn that the military and his people could rebel at any time if he continues down the path of suppression and Islamization of the government. He has made at least one step in reconciliation by dropping all ‘insult’ lawsuits against individuals who insulted him, made dank memes on Reddit of him, and Tweeted about him. There are still people withering away in prison for making fun of him, but, at least for the time being, there will be no more frivolous lawsuits and prosecutions clogging up Turkey’s justice system. Yet this is merely a tiny conciliatory step on a 100-step ladder of fair leadership.</p>
									<p>
									Much needs to change, and I personally fear that this is just the beginning.</p>
