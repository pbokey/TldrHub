									<p class="tldr">Contrary to Clinton’s beliefs, affordable healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. We’ve grown accustomed to the vast treatments at our disposal, but that doesn’t make it a “right.” Healthcare must be approached as an industry in which services and products are provided for a profit. It isn’t the government’s place to protect consumers from price changes. This may be inconvenient in the short run, but it aides in long-term progress and price. Right now, we’re in an awkward mix between free market development and government intervention—the worst place to be. </p>

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>As the 2016 general election has approached, I have started to truly dig deep into the positions of both of our country’s major parties’ presidential nominees. This process has been extremely informative and I have been very pleased with the level to which this analysis of information has enhanced my confidence in the candidate I plan to support in the coming month of November.</p>

							<p>It is any and every living organism’s instinct to fight for life. If there is a way forward, we seek it out, and if that path forward brings us personal utility, then we travel down it. Modern medicine is often our path to a longer, more fruitful life. I can attest to this because I have an autoimmune disease called type one diabetes. Without the incredible advances in insulin therapy that are available to me, my quality of life would be dismal at best. Without any past medical advancements at all, my quality of life would have become nonexistent at the time of my diagnosis, seven years ago.</p>

							<blockquote>I am immensely grateful for the affordable and stellar healthcare at my disposal, but I do not believe it is one of my basic human rights.</blockquote>

							<p>The current state of healthcare is certainly a great privilege. We don’t often associate the word privilege with healthcare, but that is because we have become so accustomed to its modern state of accessibility. In the grand scheme of things, we are not far from a time when men and women died from tooth infections, minor open wounds, a lack of basic sanitation, or even an inadequate understanding of the ways in which bacteria and viruses spread. The majority of the American population knows nothing other than readily accessible and relatively affordable healthcare, but that does not mean we are entitled to it.</p>

							<p>It is every human’s right to pursue their most ideal state of health. This means that any individual should have the freedom to place a value on their health, and then assess the possible costs of seeking the treatment and supplementation necessary in achieving the standard of health which promises them the most future utility. While healthcare is an extremely emotional topic for many, it must be approached as an industry in which services and products are provided for a profit. By stating that “affordable healthcare is a basic human right,” it is implied that it’s the duty of the government to protect the consumer of healthcare products and services from the possible changes in this industry’s prices. This protection may seem convenient to any short term consumer, but the government’s intervention in the free market system of the healthcare industry can be detrimental to its long term prices and progress.</p>

							<p>No matter your political or economic mindset, I believe it is clear that competition in most industries is healthy and productive. Companies and individuals compete to provide the most desired and valued products and services to a thrifty group of consumers. This is capitalism at its finest. The reason that healthcare has become so great in our nation in the past 150 years is that pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and medical schools have pushed their counterparts to be better. Medications have become diverse and reasonable in price, hospitals have become incredibly efficient, and medical schools have produced excellent doctors all because consumers in the healthcare industry have desired the best and businesses have sought a profit.</p>

							<p>It seems that we are reaching a point now where our nation’s healthcare system has accumulated an unhealthy mix of free market development and government intervention. Much like the current inefficiency of our divided government on the national level, a severe division between the interests of government agencies and healthcare corporations has created a healthcare system characterized by higher drug prices, more expensive insurance, and less engaged consumers.</p> 

							<p>According to a <a href = http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective> publication presented by The Commonwealth Fund in 2015</a>, the United States’ healthcare spending amounted to 17.1% of our 2013 GDP. This value is nearly 6% higher than the next highest healthcare spender, France, and 8.3% higher than the lowest spender, Great Britain. Of the thirteen nations that were studied in this publication, we are the only one without a universal healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act, enacted under the Obama administration, is a step in the direction of universal healthcare but really a half measure that has not proven significantly effective for our nation’s healthcare system as a whole. We are still spending more for healthcare per capita, both publicly and privately, than almost any other nation in the world.</p>

							<p>Our nation is currently between a free market healthcare system and a universal healthcare system. This is the worst place we could be. It would be undoubtedly beneficial to our country’s citizens in terms of both health and finances for our health care system to either move toward a free market system or one of a completely universal nature. With this being said, I believe that the first of the two is the best option for our nation simply because it values competition. As long as healthcare providers, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies are left to compete in a market free of unnecessary government regulation, prices will drop to reasonably affordable rates and the quality of these healthcare companies’ products and services will rise based on consumers’ needs.</p>

							<p>While our country does face institutional issues in the healthcare industry, we also face a culture problem. To put it simply, American health is pitiful. As a nation, we are obese, we are plagued by alcoholism and drug abuse, and we don’t exercise nearly enough. Statistically, we are one of the unhealthiest nations in the world. We are not dying of malaria, tetanus, cholera, or starvation; we are eating, drinking, and smoking ourselves to death. Type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease are the ‘American Plagues.’ I’d say America is the best in the world at three things: unnecessary consumption, racking up debt, and getting fat. As long as we continue to excel at these three things, major changes in the healthcare system will not make a huge difference in the status of American healthcare spending and the prices that go along with it.</p>

							<p>Affordable health care is the byproduct of a mutual interest in maintaining good health. A right is something that can be protected by the government and guaranteed to every one of its citizens. For the government to guarantee affordable healthcare to every one of its citizens it must impose some form of absolute control over the actions of insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare professionals. Just as we should have the individual liberty to choose the ways in which we take care of our body, companies and healthcare professionals should have the liberty to choose the ways in which they operate in the pursuit of a profitable business strategy. 

							<p>At the end of the day we want to be able to go to sleep knowing that we will wake up in the morning. The most essential element of life is the process of moving forward, getting better, and functioning as efficiently as possible. As a country with serious health and financial problems we do not need to look for more government involvement in the healthcare field. We should seek more individual responsibility sprouting from the ability to value one’s own health. Ultimately, we must allow individuals to be praised for their successful independent acts and held accountable for their unsuccessful ones. Healthcare decisions are best left to the patient, because only the patent can truly place a value on his or her own life. Instead of promising more government intervention in healthcare, why not place the focus on educating our nation’s citizens in personal health. Control only produces dependency, while education creates independence. As a nation which once gained its independence, we should know best of all how valuable it is. </p>
