Such an overrepresentation in the world’s prison population cannot be purely a moral dilemma, but one of justice. The influx is aided by discriminatory behavior both in the policing and court systems. As nonviolent offenders occupy prisons, the war on drugs has become a war on people. Rising bail costs, misleading plea deals, and racial disparities highlight the socioeconomic discrimination in the criminal justice system.</p>

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>
							<p>
							This August, President Obama granted commutations and shortened sentences for 111 people incarcerated under unjust and outdated sentencing laws. Most, if not all, of these cases were drug related and non-violent. During his presidency, Obama has shed light on the issue of mass incarceration time and time again. In his two terms, he has granted more commutations and pardons than <a href = http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/30/111-more-commutations-obama-has-doubled-his-total-month/89592834/last> the last 10 presidents combined</a>, and is the only president to visit a federal prison during his time in office. 
							</p>

							<p>
							The United States is the world leader in numerous aspects, unfortunately including mass incarceration. According to a report by the <a href = https://www.aclu.org/prison-crisis> American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the US houses 5 percent of the world’s population, but over 20 percent of the world’s prison population. This is an <a href = http://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trends-in-US-Corrections.pdf> increase of 500%</a> over the past 40 years. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Most of the incarcerations boom can be attributed to the War on Drugs era of the 1980s. Since then, there has been a <a href = https://thinkprogress.org/federal-prison-population-spiked-790-percent-since-1980-7d0681772584#.sjs5s1yeg> 790% increasea</a> in the U.S. federal prison population, meaning most of the people sentenced are <a href = http://www.november.org/razorwire/rzold/12/1201.html> nonviolent criminals</a>. In the last 20 years, 77% of the increasing prison and jail population were nonviolent offenders.
							</p> 

							<p>
							Our criminal justice system doesn’t just suffer from influx; it is also discriminatory and unjust. Within the different tiers of the criminal justice system, there are various types of discrimination.
							</p> 


							<h3>
							Rising Bail Costs
							</h3>

							<p>
							Rising bail costs, put simply, keep the poor in jail and let the rich go free, even if they are high-risk. This, coupled with the fact that poor people are <a href = http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html> convicted at a higher rate</a>, keeps the jail and prison population steadily rising. 
							</p>

							<p>
							The real cost of this is that when these people can’t afford to bail themselves out, they risk losing everything from their jobs, to their homes, to their children. They stay in jail for indeterminate amounts of time waiting for a court date. They can be held anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months. 60% of people in jail <a href = http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/magazine/the-bail-trap.html?_r=0> haven’t been convicted of anything</a>. 
							</p>

							<p>
							The American Bar Association, among others, agrees that the bail system is <a href = http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminal_justice_section_newsletter/newsletter_winter2015.authcheckdam.pdf> prejudiced against the poor</a> and needs to be reformed so that people aren’t unfairly losing their lives for a crime they might have not even committed.
							</p>

							<p>
							“It sets up a system where first there’s the punishment, and then there’s the opportunity to go to court for trial,” stated the Maryland state public defender, Paul DeWolfe.
							</p>


							<h3>
							Plea Deals
							</h3>
		
							<p>
							The issue with plea deals is that often people see this as their only option, as they’re threatened with harsher sentences and more serious charges if they don’t take them. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Not only are plea deals unfair, they also make it so that <a href = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-pleas/> 90 percent of cases</a> don’t make it to court. An observation by Yale law professor John Langbein effectively summarizes the problem with the overuse of plea deals: “There is an astonishing discrepancy between what the constitutional texts promise and what the criminal justice system delivers.” Calling it “the Devil’s Bargain,” <a href = https://reason.com/archives/2011/07/05/the-devils-bargain/print> Tim Lynch</a> explains that the framers never intended for there to even be plea deals, saying in the constitution that all trials should be in front of a jury, “except in cases of impeachment.”
							</p>

							<p>
							Originally, a person could only go to jail or prison if a jury sees him as guilty beyond reasonable doubt, but now he goes to jail if his attorney pressures him to take the shortened sentence offered after pleading guilty, rather than risk the possibility of a longer time incarcerated.
							</p>

							<p>
							Because people are more often than not accepting these plea deals, there are more people in jail or prison than there should be.<a href = http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/devils-bargain-how-plea-agreements-never-contemplated-framers-undermine-justice> The CATO Institute</a>  addresses the most common defense people have for plea deals: if all cases went to trial, there would be an overflow and courthouses would be too busy. Their response is simple and precise: “Politicians chose to expand the list of crimes, eventually turning millions of Americans into criminals. Ending the disastrous war on drugs would unclog our courts in short order.” 
							</p>


							<h3>
							Racial Disparities
							</h3>

							<p>
							Minorities and people of color can expect to be imprisoned at a <a href = https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2012/03/13/11351/the-top-10-most-startling-facts-about-people-of-color-and-criminal-justice-in-the-united-states/> higher rate</a> than white people. This doesn’t mean that black people and minorities commit more or worse crimes; it means that laws are tailored against them.
							</p>

							<p>
							For example, the <a href = https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5484>Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986</a> made sentences for selling crack cocaine longer than those for selling powder cocaine, even though scientific research has shown that they are the exact same drug. And with that comes the racial disparity. Historically, blacks are known to sell crack cocaine as opposed to whites selling powder. The same kind of disparities are seen with marijuana use; a black person is 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than a white person, according to the <a href = https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu-thewaronmarijuana-rel2.pdf> ACLU. Because of laws like this one, in 2004, blacks served the same amount for nonviolent offenses as whites did for violent ones. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Apart from our policies being outdated and essentially racist, society is tailored to see people in poverty and people of color as “dangerous.” Examples of this permeate the daily news. Sadly, even police officers do the same thing. After the ruling of Floyd v. City of New York, where four African American men claimed blacks were stopped by police officers at a disproportionate rate, a judge in New York deemed stop-and-frisk in violation of the 14th amendment. <a href = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/stop-and-frisk-landmark-ruling> The Guardian</a> tells us that “the vast majority [of people stopped] have been African American or Latino.”
							</p>

							<p>
							The United States is meant to symbolize freedom and equality, while one of our biggest problems threatens both. It’s time we stop looking at people’s lives and futures as disposable and start treating everyone that finds themselves in trouble with the law with the rights our founding fathers intended.
