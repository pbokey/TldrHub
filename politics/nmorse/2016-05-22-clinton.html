							<p class="tldr">While addressing a crowd on a campaign speech last Tuesday, Hillary Clinton referenced Monica Lewinsky, the infamous White House intern who had an affair with Bill Clinton while he was president. Mrs. Clinton was attempting to explain that she’s loyal to America even when the nation makes mistakes, just as she was loyal to her husband. “But you know what?” she said after apparently accidentally mentioning Lewinsky. “I'm pretty sure I’ve got a nicer clit than she does.” The audience cheered for three minutes straight. Both Mr. Clinton and Donald Trump released statements confirming Mrs. Clinton’s assertion.</p>

							<p><span class="city">Springfield, IL &mdash;</span> Addressing a crowd at a campaign stop in Illinois, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apparently slipped and referenced her husband’s sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky was a White House intern who admittedly had numerous sexual encounters with then-President Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1997. Over the years, Mrs. Clinton has stayed quiet about the affair, but she’s also stayed loyal to her husband.</p>
							<p>Mrs. Clinton was attempting to explain that she is loyal to America no matter what when she dropped Lewinsky’s name. “I’m just a loyal kind of person,” she shouted, gaining cheers from the crowd. “When President Obama needed a Secretary of State, I didn’t turn him down just because he ran a shitty campaign and I should’ve been president.” She then panned around, absorbing the cheering that erupted upon completion of her sentence, and made eye contact with her husband, who was standing in the back holding a Trump sign. “And when my husband stuck his penis in Monica’s mouth, I stayed loyal to him.” A slight look of repulsion immediately engulfed her face as she looked back at her aides, who were in disbelief of the reference she just made. Mrs. Clinton looked onto the crowd, now with a confident, serious face, and shouted: “But you know what? I’m pretty sure I’ve got a nicer clit than she does.”</p>
							<blockquote>"And when my husband stuck his penis in Monica’s mouth, I stayed loyal to him."</blockquote>
							<p>The crowd boomed with the highest recorded decibel levels on file for any political rally in American history. Young men swooned, elderly women cried of joy and hugged their husbands or whoever they could find, and children asked their mothers to explain what a clitoris is. Bill Clinton continued standing in the back, this time nodding his head in agreement with his wife’s assertion. Mrs. Clinton’s aides had to surround her to protect her from exuberant fans who were trying to jump up on the stage and rip up her dress to auction off pieces. After more than three minutes, the crowd finally settled down, and Clinton exited the stage.</p>
							<p>In a press conference held by Clinton’s campaign later that day, Clinton’s press secretary confirmed that the Secretary’s reference to Lewinsky was unplanned and likely spontaneous. Bill Clinton’s office published a press release stating that “while both women are beautiful, it is true that my wife has a nicer vagina.” Donald Trump, likely upset that he wasn’t getting any attention, also released a statement agreeing that Clinton’s vagina is nicer. We have not been able to confirm why Trump would know this.</p>
