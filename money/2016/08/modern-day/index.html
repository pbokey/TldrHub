However, that does not mean all of them are going straight to college. In fact, college attendance rates have experienced national decline the last few years following the Great Recession of the late 2000s. While it may appear surprising to officials and quite contrasting to general expectations, this is a context of inherent economical ethics. This is also an example of the impact of the cyclical nature of the nation’s economy on individuals; the choices made after high school are out of personal contention.</p>

									<p>The most recent data from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) — released in 2015 — affirms that today’s generation of high school students are receiving their diplomas at significantly higher rates than our parents and grandparents. Associate editor for The Atlantic Alia Wong highlighted this reality in her January 2015 article <a href = "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/01/where-are-all-the-high-school-grads-going/423285">“Where Are All the High School Grads Going?”</a> stating that national high school completion rates have peaked at just over 80 percent in the last few years. With respect to the high numbers, she directs attention to the inverse relationship with college attendance rates. She is not alone in addressing why fewer students are choosing to go to college immediately after high school. The reasons are actually rather simple: they are genuine instances of personal economic resourcefulness.</p>
									<p>
									For background context, we are recovering — for the most part — from the Great Recession of the late 2000s. Generally, college enrollment rates tend to be lower during times of economic recovery. As prevalent during a similar economic crisis, the Great Depression, consumer spending was organized into essentials for survival and investments for the long-run. <a href = "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_11072014.pdf">The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) documented in October 2014</a> that “educational services” was one of two stable sectors in both recession and depression, thriving over failing popular, commission-based industries such as “manufacturing, professional and business services, and retail trade.” What drove the educational sector was “public and private tuition and fees” for college attendance, even given circumstances of lower incomes and resources to fund college educations in order to secure occupation in demanding sectors, such as the second stable sector identified by the BLS: “health care and social assistance.”</p>
									<p> 
									It is important to note that not every economic recession is considered a crisis. Nonetheless, recessions often see a gender polarization in technical studies at the collegiate level. Josh Zumbrun of the Wall Street Journal <a href = "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/17/the-fields-that-students-flock-to-during-recessions"> shares in his article “Fields Students Tend to Flock to During Recessions”</a> says men will tend to choose to study in fields of engineering and product-driven majors while women tend to choose business/finance and nursing. Directions of major study and changes of majors were also graphed to be influenced by increases in unemployment. In other words, people in college, most of whom are now women, are more likely to focus their time in college to gain essential skills and qualifications for trending industries in times of economic decline.</p>
									<p>
									Today, it is not by any means difficult for people — especially young people — to find decent-paying jobs, or difficult-to-find jobs in general. It is also not imperative to have a bachelor’s degree to qualify for many high-demand, skilled-labor jobs, including commercial transportation and sales representation, as listed by Forbes. Several factors influence high school graduates to not limiting consideration of plans to continuing their education in college, such as pursuing professions that can make a difference in a community. The most powerful, however, happens to be what they can afford in order to make a difference.</p>
									<p>
									I believe, to a certain extent, that we live in an era of prospect and perspective. I find it extraordinarily difficult to possess the idea that no one young wants to have some impact on the world around him or her. Unfortunately, there are divides that can limit what someone in one economic class may pursue than another, particularly the lower-income class. While more high school students today are either graduating or passing equivalency examinations, the students from families of the lower-income class are actually less likely to continue their education after years of compulsory education. The U.S. Census Bureau has shown a growing decline in students from low-income families going to college over the last few decades. This doesn’t mean it is becoming impossible for these students to afford the ever-rising costs of tuition and fees for an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. In fact, the U.S. government has even tried to intervene.</p>
									<p>
									Scholarship and grants like the Pell Grant, which is exclusively for financial-aid seeking individuals, have been put forth from the government in order to help the lower-income class afford college expenses. Regardless, they still experience a decline in attendance. Many experts from the Department of Commerce and NCES see that the divide is due to individuals not seeing the cost of going to a college or university all of its worth. Entering the work force, they argue, is a more tangible alternative. For instance, they may feel work is typically local, pay is generally acceptable for living, and the skills learned on the job are sometimes more practical than sitting through hours of lecture halls and writing papers.</p>
									<p> 
									This is not saying there are people from this economic class not going to college, or that higher-income classes are not under similar beliefs of skilled-labor advantages over a college experience. Choosing to go to college does carry burdens and benefits for those who so choose to enroll. There is reason to say, though, that college is not exactly as remarkable as it once was. There are certain degrees that are, for lack of better term, useless. For exemplary purposes, Gender Studies, Women’s Studies, African-American Studies, Asian-American Studies, or anything with the word “Studies” after it are not pragmatic fields of study to spend thousands of dollars on with the hopes of securing a job outside of teaching those specific subjects. I am in no way trying to sound racist, bigoted, or misogynistic. I am only trying to provide some perspective on how far someone may use a college degree of this caliber in the professional world.</p>
									<p>
									Other degree fields, such as most popular liberal arts, namely English, History, Mathematics, and others. require advanced degrees beyond the bachelor’s in order to distinguish oneself from many others who also hold those very undergraduate degrees. This can also bring about financial burdens to those looking to extend their educational qualifications, and, therefore, discouragement and disillusionment.</p>
									<p>
									Even in light of the depressing sides, college can still be a good choice. College can provide many opportunities for social and intellectual maturity through community events, fraternity service organizations, athletics, rigorous study, and on and on, while also opening new insights and mindsets to those who seek them to challenge what they already believe and develop original positions on a multitude of conceptions.</p>
									<p>
									In all fairness, the decision of choosing to go to college or not is — as it should be — a personal choice. What should matter, in retrospect, is that the individual making such decision is using their resources of time, money, and satisfaction in the most personal beneficial way they see fit. Whatever the decision might be, with respect to various socioeconomic factors, they are, in fact, genuine instances of personal economic resourcefulness by the young person who is determining his or her own prosperity.</p>
