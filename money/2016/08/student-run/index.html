College campuses have big demand for these fans at this time of year, so FanU may become a popular name among students.</p>

							<p>One student at the University of Florida believes he has struck gold with a newfound idea. Isaac Hetzroni, a first-year marketing major, is quickly making a name for himself as a successful entrepreneur on campus. His idea and business is blowing up and making people talk in a way he never thought possible.</p>
							<p>
							The company, “FanU,” sells portable fans that plug into your mobile device. It all started with a small idea and a big ambition. Hetzroni says that he originally bought one for himself, as he was constantly sweating during his commutes to class in the summer, and immediately saw the opportunity for demand on campus.</p>
							<p>
							He began by selling them to friends, family, and students around town. He started by reselling unbranded prototypes of his device. He now boasts 22 employees at seven different universities, along with a brand name, branded models of the device, and even school colors for each campus that FanU has reached. From selling 10 units at a time to making shipments of over 1,000 portable fans, Hetzroni has definitely built up some confidence in the company. “FanU is going to be big,” he says. “We aren’t going to be making peer-to-peer sales for much longer. … Soon you’ll see us in the bookstores, as handouts for each club on campus, even at the next concert or big event. Look out for FanU.”</p>
							<p>
							In a hot and humid place like Florida, having access to a small portable fan definitely can be nice. By producing fans in school colors, FanU could be the next big thing on game days as 90,000 people cram into Ben Hill Griffin Stadium to support the Orange and Blue, with temperatures upwards of 90 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll continue to follow FanU and see if Hetzroni can make his entrepreneurial dreams come true.</p>
