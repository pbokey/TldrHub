Not many people learn about finance, yet everyone has to deal with money in life. After graduating, very few people know anything about saving, budgeting, taxes, or anything related. Every high school student should be required to take a course in personal finance so that we can have a smarter, more money-conscious society.</p>

									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>About a year ago, after encouragement from my parents, I decided to start saving for retirement. I didn’t know much about finances, but I heard that I should open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whatever that is. I found a calculator online to see how much I would earn if I started saving now versus in a few years, and I was shocked at the differences. If I put in $1,000 to a Roth IRA at age 18 and pledged $2,000 per year until I was 65, the final total would be $728,586. That’s more than double what it would be if I started even just ten years later, at age 28 — $335,346. Basically, the earlier the better.</p>
									<p>
									As I looked into savings plans, though, I realized how little I knew about finances and money. Apparently IRAs usually put a person’s money into mutual funds, and the person must either determine which funds should get the money or pay a professional advisor to manage it. As I was researching this further to understand it, I was faced with confusing terms and foreign concepts about money.
									<p>
									Why aren’t public schools teaching students more about finances? In the long run, what is more important: learning every detail of medieval European politics, or understanding something as basic as managing your money? I could not care less about the binomial nomenclature of some creepy Amazonian frog, but after graduating I’m realizing I care much more about making sure I have enough money to live well. And it’s not just about understanding the workings of complicated retirement accounts — it’s about educating the public from a young age on staying out of debt, spending wisely, planning for the future, and even dealing with the IRS.</p>
									<p>
									If our education standards are designed to make high school students well-rounded by giving them exposure to subjects they won’t necessarily need in their field, surely we can require just one semester out of four years to be dedicated to learning how to navigate the universal struggle of money. Students pursuing careers in science still have to learn English and history; students going into the arts still have to learn math and science. They don’t always like it, but having a strong background in all four of the core areas is crucial to being an intelligent person. But equally important (if not, more) is money.
									I sort of alluded to what I am proposing in the previous paragraph, but now let’s spell it out: every state needs to require a personal finance course of at least one semester that each student must take to graduate high school. We shouldn’t be sending children out into the world with skills of solving logarithms and interpreting poetry but without basic money management skills. This course needs to teach people about the dangers of loan debt, credit card debt, and overspending, as well as how to save money, plan for the future, and file taxes.</p>
									<p>
									Maybe requiring a course like that is too bold too quick. Maybe we should start with requiring every school to offer the course, but make it optional for students to take. Perhaps it could count as a math credit or have other perks. My high school didn’t have any such class, so even mandating its presence at every school will do well for the public. The bottom line: we need to equip high school students with the knowledge they need to be successful with their money in the real world. No matter what field a person is in, he or she will always deal with money.
