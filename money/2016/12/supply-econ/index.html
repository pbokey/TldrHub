							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>

							<p>
							Greetings all. For those who are just joining us and for returning readers, I’m Gabriel Woodruff and I will be explaining the idea of supply today. What comes to your mind when I say supply? More than likely you are thinking of a specific amount of something (the supply of food in your fridge for an example). You are correct in your assumption! However, supply in economics is more complex and vast than a counting number; it is a conceptual idea on how certain forces in the market affect the given amount of something at any given period of time. Okay, I know that was a mouthful, so I will break it down. 
							</p>

							<p><span class = subheading>Supply: The definition</span></p>

							<p>
							I am a big fan of Investopedia for my sources, so I will call upon it for laying the foundation. <a href = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp> Investopedia states</a> that supply is a fundamental economic concept that describes the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to consumers. I know what you are thinking right now: “Gabriel, I could have guessed that!” and I have no doubt of it, but let’s talk for a little bit.
							</p>

							<p>
							Supply is correlated to many things in our world, such as preferences, market forces, business models, how useful it is (utility); I can go on for a while about this. </p>

							<p>
							There are “forces” that prod and poke supply up or down. Generally, as the price of a good goes up, there will be a larger supply of it. Think about it like this: you bake cookies and your cookies are delicious beyond comprehension. You start selling them, and not unsurprisingly, demand exceeds supply. That means when people are buying more of them than you can produce. So naturally, you increase the supply by baking more cookies to sell. </p>

							<p>
							Conversely, if your cookies are not up to par, less of them will be sold and you will cut supply by not baking as much; maybe give cakes a try? That is a very simple version of supply. It isn’t just price that affects how much of something exists for consumption. Take two laptop computers that would both provide what you need. These computers can use advanced software you need for classes (Excel charts anyone?), they both have powerful processors, and they are generally pretty well-built machines. Also, you are not biased toward any brands. Which one do you choose? You would choose the laptop that is the cheapest.</p>
							
							<p>
							These goods in this instance are called substitutes. The <a href = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitute.asp?ad=dirN&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&qsrc=0&o=40186>definition</a> states that a substitute good is a good that is similar to another. Essentially, the consumer will choose one good over another. Brand name oat cereal versus General Mills is another example. If you, the consumer, see both of these goods as substitutes, you will then go for the generic and save some money. </p>

							<p>
							On the other side of the equation, there are complement goods. A <a href = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/complement.asp>complement good</a> is a good that affects the supply and demand of another good that “complements” it. It is a safe assumption that millennials love chips and salsa, so if the price of salsa goes up, the demand of chips will go down, and the supply of the chips will fall. (Salsa will follow suit theoretically; no one just wants expensive salsa with no chips to go with it!)</p>



							<p><span class = subheading>Instance in the world</span></p>

							<p>
							I love coffee with an unhealthy tendency. I enjoy it black, with milk, as an espresso, ice, and beyond. Did you all know that coffee is getting more expensive? <a href = http://fortune.com/2016/07/28/coffee-prices-expensive/>Fortune Magazine</a> says that there is a supply deficit of coffee in global markets. Oh no. This is due to rising demand from other nations as well as from your classmates.  Also, a drought in Brazil cut the supply of coffee outside of the control of the farmers.</p>

							<p>
							Simply put: there is not enough coffee to go around to meet how much everyone desires that cup of joe. So now with a tightened supply, prices are rising on what little coffee is available. It makes sense once you think about it; the rarer something is, the higher the price is expected. Our infamous addiction to coffee as a species is become more expensive for us.</p>
