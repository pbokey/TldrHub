							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>Hello millennials, and welcome to the start of the series 5-Minute Economics with yours truly, Gabriel Woodruff! I am an undergraduate student who is majoring in Economics at Florida State University (Go Noles!), and I want to take out all of the jargon and confusing ideas and theories of Economics and teach it in a way that you can understand it and apply it to your daily existence.</p>
							<p>
							Having an understanding of economics will give you an explanation to many things: How does the shortage of pork affect prices on retailers and the food industry? Would I get more consumer surplus from buying that textbook from the college bookstore or Amazon? How do oil prices affect me? You get the idea. So let’s start!
							</p>
							<p><span class = subheading>Economics: The Definition</span></p>
							<p>
							Economics can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and that can be misleading, to say the least. Economics defined from the neutral source of <a href = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/economics>  Dictionary.com </a> says that aside from being a noun, it is: “the science that deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, or the material welfare of humankind.”</p>
							<p>
							Hey, that seems cool! There is an actual science behind that stuff? Well, yes, although Economics isn’t a true hard science (that pertains to the natural sciences), it is still rigorous in its own right. Economics studies many things and many occurrences in our world. Some examples would be the price of a good and at what “equilibrium” price consumers will purchase it, or how a Super bowl game held in a certain city will boost its economy.</p>

							<p>Economics is often broken into two big parts: Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. Let’s look at both definitions:</p>
							<p>
							<a href = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/macroeconomics?s=t>Macroeconomics:</a> “The branch of economics dealing with the broad and general aspects of an economy, as the relationship between the income and investments of a country as a whole.”
							This is the big picture! This is that enlarged view of our world and of economies and how things such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and worldly events affect the economics environment (Brexit, anyone?).  How would the outcome of the United States presidential race affect things? These are just a few things to consider and what people attempt to solve and explain.</p>
							<p>
							<a href = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/microeconomics?s=t>Microeconomics:</a> “The branch of economics dealing with particular aspects of an economy, as the price-cost relationship of a firm.”
							I like to describe this as the more personal side of economics; on the daily, chances are this is what you experience. Longer lines than usual in a restaurant? Maybe the restaurant management cut labor to save on costs. Why is my Uber ride more expensive now than it was an hour ago? These are some instances of microeconomics at work.
							</p>
							<p><span class = subheading >Give me some education</span></p>
							<p>
							Let’s start with every economist’s bread and butter: Supply and Demand. As this is just an introductory article, I will divulge more in-depth in later publications.</p>
							<p>
							When you hear the word “supply,” images or ideas of the amount of something in particular comes to mind. As it turns out, the definition of supply isn’t too far different from the economic definition. Supply is defined by <a href = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp>Investopedia</a> as a foundational concept “that describes the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to consumers.” This concept is used everywhere by every business or institution, private as well.</p>
							<p>
							Demand is the other side of this equation. Using the <a href = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp> same source</a>: demand is the “consumer’s desire and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service.” I am sure you all have been in a store and saw the price of an item and had a thought similar to “What?! I am not paying that!” That is demand at work! At certain prices, consumers will “demand” certain goods in a certain amount. It’s nifty once you think about it.</p>
							<p><span class = subheading>Instance in the world</span></p>
							<p>
							But Gabriel, how does economics affect me? A <a href = http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2016/09/markets-0> recent article from The Economist </a> that talks about the stock market and current events that could be behind it. The article talks about a major sell-off of bonds and equities and how investors are pondering what to do next. What happens when central banks stop interacting with the market? What will the outcome of the U.S. presidential race have on these markets? This article gives you an idea of the dynamism of forces that affect economic activity. I urge you all to read the article and do independent investigation on what you learn about.</p>
