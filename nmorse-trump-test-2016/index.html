							<p class="tldr">The American Political Science Association (APSA) commenced its annual convention yesterday, and experts voted earlier this morning to upgrade Donald J. Trump from “Asshole” status to “Superasshole” status. The APSA has scales on which it ranks each major political figure based on political ideology, success, and character, as determined by a majority vote of the members present at the convention. The “character” scale ranges from “Sweet Old Man” to “Superasshole.” Trump is now the first political figure in APSA history to receive a status of “Superasshole.” Senator Bernie Sanders is the currently the only politician with “Sweet Old Man” status.</p>

							<p><span class="city">Washington, DC &mdash;</span> Every year, the American Political Science Association (APSA) convenes in Washington, DC, for its Annual Political Science Convention. Professors, analysts, researchers, political operatives, political pundits, and career politicians from all over the nation flood in to discuss ideas and findings from the past year. Last year, a group of political scientists from the Cato Institute announced they had discovered <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/political-scientists-discover-new-form-of-governme-5899">a highly unstable form of government called megalocracy</a>, which had been theorized by Winston Churchill but never confirmed until recently. <a class="fn-link" href="#fn">[1]</a> Scientists at the convention also vote on standards for the national political science community, such as definitions and rankings.</p>
							<p>The 2016 Convention adjourned late last night after some groundbreaking rankings were passed. Most notably, Donald Trump was upgraded from “Asshole” status to “Superasshole.” This is part of the APSA’s Character Ranking system, one of three systems that rate every politician on the state and federal level as well as every candidate for any position. The other two systems are the Ideology Scale and Success Ratings. In the weeks leading up to the convention, nearly every member sits on at least one of the dozens of local committees that look at the public figures in their areas to rate them in those three systems. The committee’s recommendations are then considered by all of the members at the convention, requiring a simple majority vote to pass.</p>
							<p>The most powerful of these committees is the Federal Unitary Committee (FUC), which rates candidates and politicians at the federal level. This year, when the FUC submitted its recommendations, many APSA members were shocked. For the first time in history, a committee had recommended “Superasshole” status to a political figure for the Character Rankings. This is the worst character ranking APSA can give. Trump had previously maintained “Asshole,” which is right below it. While relatively few APSA members are Trump supporters, the few who do support him were furious.</p>
							<p>“This is just liberal propaganda designed to hurt Trump in the election,” says Samuel Matthews, a political science professor at George Mason University. “The public will see the ‘superasshole’ status and think Trump shouldn’t be President. If they see him as just an asshole, though, he might actually have a chance.”</p>
							<p>Other APSA members believe it’s a necessary move. Ashlyn Wallace, for example, told us that the APSA’s ranking reflects public opinion, not the other way around. “The fact is, people already see Trump as a superasshole, and continuing to carelessly call him just an asshole isn’t going to change that.” Wallace then went on to detail her personal sexual history with Trump as evidence that he is a superasshole. <a class="fn-link" href="#fn">[2]</a></p>
							
							<h3>Subheading</h3>
							<p>But how will this actually affect the public? To find out, we asked random people on the street what they thought of Trump’s new ranking. “What the fuck is APSA?” one bystander asked us. Another simply said that <i>we</i> should be awarded “superasshole” status. The consensus was that Trump is at least an asshole, but most people we talked to did not understand or care about the significance of changing his status.</p>
							<p>The FUC’s recommendations also awarded Senator Bernie Sanders the “Sweet Old Man” status, which is the nicest possible status APSA can award. Hillary Clinton was given “Annoying Grandma” status, and Ted Cruz maintained his “Asshole” status. The recommendations of the FUC were passed 953-47. The forty-seven members who voted against it were burned at the stake and cursed by three APSA wiccans. Vandy Elra, the official APSA psychic, reports that the forty-seven members were sent to Hell upon judgment.</p>
