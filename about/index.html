									<h2 class="post-title">About Us</h2>
									<p class="tldr">At TldrHub, we publish high-quality articles with a brand new approach to news and analysis. Unlike other news sites, each article has a 100-word summary, called a “tldr.” Another unique feature about TldrHub is that we encourage and publish opinion pieces from various perspectives, whether that be liberal, conservative, or anything in between. TldrHub started from a goal to create a true news site that allows readers to come to their own opinions, but it soon transformed into a platform where brevity and efficiency is the name of the game.</p>

								<h4>Chief Executive Officer</h4>
							</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Pranav is currently a freshman studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. The idea for this site came to him after seeing the heavily biased articles filled with different agendas from various spectrums of media on his Facebook and Twitter feed. From that disdain for such opinionated “news” came the birth of a new company. As CEO of the company, Pranav oversees all operations and projects and manages its growth. He is also an integral part of the development team. He hopes that this company can blossom into a forefront source of news for millennials in the near future.</p>
