												<p>As tensions between civilians and police departments grow, accusations and blame are plentiful while solutions are few. Many, like Fox News pundit Bill O’Reilly, have cited black-on-black crime and “black culture” as the true culprit. This takes the focus away from police brutality to the supposed innate savagery of African Americans. But there’s been no mention of “white-on-white” crime. Because both “white-on-white” and “black-on-black” crime is simply crime. Poor whites and poor blacks commit roughly the same amount of crimes. The only reason they usually commit these against their own group is because they live around each other.</p>

												<p>During July, pride month, and in the wake of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, people took to twitter to support a #HeterosexualPrideDay. Why do heterosexuals need a day dedicated to their sexual orientation when they don’t fear for their life because of it? By calling for a #HeterosexualPrideDay, people are erasing the struggles the LGBT community has faced and continues to face.</p>

												<p>While the majority of society is quick to dismiss a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, there are definitely things that you should consider before dismissing it yourself. With my decision to become a vegetarian came many realizations that confirmed my choice to be a good one. Ditching meat made me realize that I should not love certain animals yet eat others, that I can have a balanced diet sans meat, and that my diet affects more than just myself. Most importantly, I realized that my voice and efforts toward a change bigger than myself matter immeasurably.</p>

Her actions were highly controversial, but she was unapologetic in how she approached life. Baloch inspired many young women with her confidence, and her death has caused the Pakistani government to take a closer look at current laws surrounding honor killings.</p>

												<p>While Trump did in fact receive more votes in Republican primaries than any nominee in history, this statistic is dangerously misleading because voter turnout was also at a record high. Trump only received 45% of the vote, making him the least popular GOP nominee in modern history. In the context of the last few decades, though, this could just indicate party disunity. Democrats have had different trends that are harder to decipher. Regardless, this will be one of the most important elections in U.S. history.</p>

The cause of the disappearance has been found; it is a matter of stopping it before it’s too late and raising concern about the declining bee population. Colony collapses are occurring more rapidly than ever, and if we don’t change our ways, we could easily cause the mass extinction of our best pollinators—along with the entire human race.</p>

												<p>Contrary to Clinton’s beliefs, affordable healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. We’ve grown accustomed to the vast treatments at our disposal, but that doesn’t make it a “right.” Healthcare must be approached as an industry in which services and products are provided for a profit. It isn’t the government’s place to protect consumers from price changes. This may be inconvenient in the short run, but it aides in long-term progress and price. Right now, we’re in an awkward mix between free market development and government intervention—the worst place to be. </p>

												<p>Party politics has divided us as a nation. We’ve strayed from the vision of George Washington, who employed a split cabinet so all opinions could be heard. Partisanship has permeated our media, and moderate candidates have become rare. Political parties have their place — allowing like-minded individuals to come together and to voice their opinions — but they have made us lazy and forced us to not even consider the stances of a different party. Big money in politics has made politicians slaves to extreme party ideology and lobbyists. We must focus on bipartisan issues to create a stronger, more “united” America.</p>
