												<p>Paul Ryan has become both an inspiration and a role model for politicians and the general public. Finding politicians with both integrity and honesty is so rare that Ryan is a breath of fresh air to many who are tired of the corruption in Washington. Paul Ryan has become a unifying face of the Republican party while reflecting bravery, family values, and being a  prime example of a public servant who not only serves but understands the common people. </p>

												<p>Millennials tend to be more concerned about the environment than older generations. This may be for several reasons — we’ve had more exposure to environmental programs than our parents’ generation, and they’re more concerned with national security and economic issues. Public opinion won’t change overnight, but there are many things we can do to push our society toward more environmentally-friendly policies: vote, be seen, be heard, and make small differences.</p>

												<p>Adidas has gone beyond the realm of athletics to take on the runway. They’ve teamed up with rapper Kanye West to expand beyond the courts to the street, including urban street wear to their clothing line. Nude colors and earth tones have become a fashion staple, courtesy of Kanye. The infamous “Yeezys” have bridged the gap between casual and activewear into a well-designed sneaker for all occasions. This is the biggest collaboration between a sports brand and non-athlete. Will Kanye become a fashion Icon beyond his 3 seasons of Yeezy? Only time will tell. </p>

												<p>Following the Orlando shooting, I saw mourning, ignorance, and bigotry. I witnessed multiple communities being placed into the “other” category as whole cities split along divisions such as race, religion, skin color, and party affiliation. Despite differences, it was the people who had the biggest excuse to discriminate and demonize that chose to embrace those differences and come together as a community. The entire Orlando community came together to aid the victims. If multiple communities within Orlando who are seemingly so different can come together, why can’t politicians?</p>

												<p>I can’t tell you much about the detailed policies of the 2016 presidential candidates, but I can chime in on the image that the candidates are painting for themselves and the United States through their social presences, and how that image will affect our country. Trump has portrayed himself as childish and racist, while Clinton has come off as untrustworthy and out-of-touch. Going into this election, we need to seriously consider the character of our candidates when voting.</p>

											<p>Last October, Florida passed a law criminalizing revenge porn to prevent people from posting sexually-explicit images of others online. However, the law is too specific for many offenders to actually be convicted. Some argue this is a violation of free speech and makes it difficult to distinguish pornography from images of breastfeeding or nudity in textbooks. Others say it doesn’t suppress free speech because it protects victims from emotional distress, and the law is specific enough to exclude educational materials. Regardless, this controversial law and similar legislation will likely be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
