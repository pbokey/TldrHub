												<p>While the majority of society is quick to dismiss a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, there are definitely things that you should consider before dismissing it yourself. With my decision to become a vegetarian came many realizations that confirmed my choice to be a good one. Ditching meat made me realize that I should not love certain animals yet eat others, that I can have a balanced diet sans meat, and that my diet affects more than just myself. Most importantly, I realized that my voice and efforts toward a change bigger than myself matter immeasurably.</p>

												<p>Qandeel Baloch, a 26-year-old social media activist from Pakistan, was murdered by her brother in an honor killing in July. The family breadwinner, she was a staunch feminist. Her actions were highly controversial, but she was unapologetic in how she approached life. Baloch inspired many young women with her confidence, and her death has caused the Pakistani government to take a closer look at current laws surrounding honor killings.</p>

												<p>While Trump did in fact receive more votes in Republican primaries than any nominee in history, this statistic is dangerously misleading because voter turnout was also at a record high. Trump only received 45% of the vote, making him the least popular GOP nominee in modern history. In the context of the last few decades, though, this could just indicate party disunity. Democrats have had different trends that are harder to decipher. Regardless, this will be one of the most important elections in U.S. history.</p>

												<p>Honeybee disappearance is a rising concern to the human population, as bees are the very reason we have as much food as we do. The cause of the disappearance has been found; it is a matter of stopping it before it’s too late and raising concern about the declining bee population. Colony collapses are occurring more rapidly than ever, and if we don’t change our ways, we could easily cause the mass extinction of our best pollinators—along with the entire human race.</p>

												<p>Contrary to Clinton’s beliefs, affordable healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. We’ve grown accustomed to the vast treatments at our disposal, but that doesn’t make it a “right.” Healthcare must be approached as an industry in which services and products are provided for a profit. It isn’t the government’s place to protect consumers from price changes. This may be inconvenient in the short run, but it aides in long-term progress and price. Right now, we’re in an awkward mix between free market development and government intervention—the worst place to be. </p>

												<p>Party politics has divided us as a nation. We’ve strayed from the vision of George Washington, who employed a split cabinet so all opinions could be heard. Partisanship has permeated our media, and moderate candidates have become rare. Political parties have their place — allowing like-minded individuals to come together and to voice their opinions — but they have made us lazy and forced us to not even consider the stances of a different party. Big money in politics has made politicians slaves to extreme party ideology and lobbyists. We must focus on bipartisan issues to create a stronger, more “united” America.</p>

They’ve teamed up with rapper Kanye West to expand beyond the courts to the street, including urban street wear to their clothing line. Nude colors and earth tones have become a fashion staple, courtesy of Kanye. The infamous “Yeezys” have bridged the gap between casual and activewear into a well-designed sneaker for all occasions. This is the biggest collaboration between a sports brand and non-athlete. Will Kanye become a fashion Icon beyond his 3 seasons of Yeezy? Only time will tell. </p>

I witnessed multiple communities being placed into the “other” category as whole cities split along divisions such as race, religion, skin color, and party affiliation. Despite differences, it was the people who had the biggest excuse to discriminate and demonize that chose to embrace those differences and come together as a community. The entire Orlando community came together to aid the victims. If multiple communities within Orlando who are seemingly so different can come together, why can’t politicians?</p>
