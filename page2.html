												<p>Over the last few years, there have been countless rumors about when R&B singer Frank Ocean’s newest album will come out. And as each rumor turns out to be fake, Frank’s fans continue to get more desperate for the album to come out. Many artists would disclaim the rumors or just right out reveal when they will release their album, but not Frank. He uses the frustration of his audience to put more attention into his name. As they use social media to show their frustration, Frank is blissfully enjoying all the free PR he is getting.</p>

												<p>Religious and government propaganda in the media are constantly condemning and demonizing women who get abortions (and people who give abortions). What people don’t consider is that every woman thinks long and hard before she decides to terminate a fetus. Whether she is unable to support the child, does not want the child, or unwillingly conceived the child, she doesn’t have to have a kid if she doesn’t want to-and you can’t force her to.</p>

												<p>I’m a liberal, vegetarian, feminist, and former Bernie Sanders campaigner. Possibly the definition of what some might consider an SJW, or social justice warrior. As such, a conservative political summer camp wouldn’t exactly be my scene. But after spending my summer playing volleyball, making late night ice cream runs, listening to conservative guest speakers, and debating my newly-found Republican friends, I came to a realization — friendship is, or at least should be, a bipartisan relationship. Acceptance doesn’t constitute agreement, but it demonstrates willingness to listen to all sides of an issue, and that is the mark of maturity.</p>

												<p>As tensions between civilians and police departments grow, accusations and blame are plentiful while solutions are few. Many, like Fox News pundit Bill O’Reilly, have cited black-on-black crime and “black culture” as the true culprit. This takes the focus away from police brutality to the supposed innate savagery of African Americans. But there’s been no mention of “white-on-white” crime. Because both “white-on-white” and “black-on-black” crime is simply crime. Poor whites and poor blacks commit roughly the same amount of crimes. The only reason they usually commit these against their own group is because they live around each other.</p>

												<p>During July, pride month, and in the wake of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, people took to twitter to support a #HeterosexualPrideDay. Why do heterosexuals need a day dedicated to their sexual orientation when they don’t fear for their life because of it? By calling for a #HeterosexualPrideDay, people are erasing the struggles the LGBT community has faced and continues to face.</p>

												<p>While the majority of society is quick to dismiss a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, there are definitely things that you should consider before dismissing it yourself. With my decision to become a vegetarian came many realizations that confirmed my choice to be a good one. Ditching meat made me realize that I should not love certain animals yet eat others, that I can have a balanced diet sans meat, and that my diet affects more than just myself. Most importantly, I realized that my voice and efforts toward a change bigger than myself matter immeasurably.</p>

Her actions were highly controversial, but she was unapologetic in how she approached life.

												<p>While Trump did in fact receive more votes in Republican primaries than any nominee in history, this statistic is dangerously misleading because voter turnout was also at a record high. Trump only received 45% of the vote, making him the least popular GOP nominee in modern history. In the context of the last few decades, though, this could just indicate party disunity. Democrats have had different trends that are harder to decipher. Regardless, this will be one of the most important elections in U.S. history.</p>

Colony collapses are occurring more rapidly than ever, and if we don’t change our ways, we could easily cause the mass extinction of our best pollinators—along with the entire human race.</p>

												<p>Contrary to Clinton’s beliefs, affordable healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. We’ve grown accustomed to the vast treatments at our disposal, but that doesn’t make it a “right.” Healthcare must be approached as an industry in which services and products are provided for a profit. It isn’t the government’s place to protect consumers from price changes. This may be inconvenient in the short run, but it aides in long-term progress and price. Right now, we’re in an awkward mix between free market development and government intervention—the worst place to be. </p>
