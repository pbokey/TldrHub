												<p>Supply is a foundational economic concept that is used to show and explain the phenomena of why a certain amount of something exists. The idea does not have a limit, as it can be applied to everything from consumer goods to interest rates and more. Supply is affected by how much people want of a good, and it can have a large impact on prices. Think about this the next time you notice a price and ponder it.</p>

												<p>Make America great again. Build that wall. Kick out the illegals. In the span of Trump’s candidacy, I’ve heard these phrases millions of times. To Trump supporters, they’re buzzwords, energizing their cause. But to me, they’re exhausting and overused. 

							                    Sometimes it feels like Trump’s whole campaign is built behind this ideological wall. But the wall, like his candidacy, is absurd — not only useless, but counterproductive. 

							                    This is because illegal immigration isn’t on the rise — illegal immigrants leave at the same rate they come in. The wall wouldn’t stop illegal immigration anyway. And it’s a waste of time and money.</p>

												<p>The United States is the world leader in mass incarceration despite making up only 5 percent of the world’s population. Such an overrepresentation in the world’s prison population cannot be purely a moral dilemma, but one of justice. The influx is aided by discriminatory behavior both in the policing and court systems. As nonviolent offenders occupy prisons, the war on drugs has become a war on people. Rising bail costs, misleading plea deals, and racial disparities highlight the socioeconomic discrimination in the criminal justice system.</p>

												<p>Economics is all about decision making and looking at the big picture of what affects our decisions. It’s broken into two categories: Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. Macroeconomics looks at the big picture and explains how global events such as Brexit or presidential elections affect the economy. Microeconomics looks at details and explains everything from restaurant lines to Uber prices. A major concept of economics is supply and demand, which deals with how much of a good or service there is and how much people want it. Overall, economics helps us understand how the world works. </p>

The public school system should dedicate time to discuss the attacks on September 11th, meaning discussing both the true roots of terror and the aftermath in an academic setting.

												<p>When you catch the “travel bug,” you fall in love with traveling and everything that traveling brings. Going on trips around the world makes people more appreciative and caring, and it even forces people to be more active and to perform physical activities they wouldn’t otherwise do. Traveling also almost always brings up many unexpected problems, which can improve a person’s problem-solving skills and flexibility in other areas of life. On top of being fun and relaxing, travel makes people healthier, happier, and smarter.</p>

												<p>While most of the Western world is fixated on increasing the availability of abortions, China is experiencing a whole other problem. Its one-child policy was a response to China’s population growth problem, but it quickly created a whole range of serious problems, including a violent culture against having more than one child, ghost children, skyrocketed costs of raising a child, a massive elderly population, and even illegal immigration. China recently changed its one-child policy to a two-child policy, but the damage has already been done, and it wasn’t worth it.</p>

												<p>When discussing fashion, Vogue is often called the Fashion Bible, and the month of September is often called the January of Fashion. It is no surprise, then, that the September issue of Vogue is the most coveted and most important issue every year. From its impact to its width to its cover, if you are going to buy only one fashion magazine, buy the September issue.</p>

												<p>The mystery of dark matter has remained unexplained since its discovery in 1932. We still cannot account for nearly 96% of the mass of our universe, yet no one’s explanation for this “missing matter” is conclusive. However, a new theory has arrived on the scene, supported by the recent discoveries of LIGO. With our rapidly-increasing understanding of gravitational waves, primordial black holes have been identified as a likely candidate to explain dark matter. For the first time ever, we may have built an eye that can finally see into the dark.</p>

												<p>Police forces under the control of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte have killed nearly one thousand people in attempts to combat drug use. Human rights in the Philippines have become virtually invisible since the beginning of the drug war two months ago. Despite international intentions to intrude on the country’s sovereignty for humanitarian purposes, no legitimate actions have been successfully taken against the Philippine government so far. Duterte has broken international law and ignored human rights to combat drug crime. Crime does not excuse murder.</p>

												<p>Brazil is struggling with a corrupt national government, weakened economy, brutal police and gang behavior, and the Zika virus, all while trying to host the Olympics. The Olympics Games have grown into a multibillion-dollar event, which has caused revenue, coverage, and scandal to multiply. The IOC pits cities against each other to compete for the Olympic bid, searching for the city can produce the most lavish and extravagant Olympics plan. This increases the burden on host nations, which are often unable to foot the bill. This practice is unsustainable and is proof that the IOC needs to be reformed. </p>

												<p>Fashion is a great way of expressing yourself and boosting confidence. Owning expensive, high-end clothing isn’t pretentious; it’s a way of showing creativity, and it’s also an investment. Buying a Hermès Birkin bag, for instance, can be a more solid investment than stocks or gold. Ideal pieces for women to get include boots, dresses, and bags, while ideal pieces for men include suits, watches, and sneakers.</p>

												<p>With the detection and confirmation of gravitational waves in early 2016, scientists are pushing to improve instrumentation and sharpen our ability to observe even more occurrences. Even now, the technological implications of such a discovery are profound — though, we have barely skimmed the surface and are wading ever-deeper into the unknown. If one takes the time to understand the science behind these waves and how they work, one can imagine how useful further investigation of this brand new field will be.</p>

												<p>Recent national data has shown that this decade’s high school students are graduating at astounding rates. However, that does not mean all of them are going straight to college. In fact, college attendance rates have experienced national decline the last few years following the Great Recession of the late 2000s. While it may appear surprising to officials and quite contrasting to general expectations, this is a context of inherent economical ethics. This is also an example of the impact of the cyclical nature of the nation’s economy on individuals; the choices made after high school are out of personal contention.</p>

The Democratic Alliance has gained increasing control, ensuring that the new political party will have representation in the government. South Africa has not only created plurality in their single dominant party system, but has endorsed a temporary end to the nation’s notorious racial politics.

												<p>As a feminist and aspiring politician, Hillary Clinton’s career, campaign, and DNC speech have inspired me to strive to achieve my greatest heights in politics and beyond. Despite all our achievements, until now a woman has never been chosen by a major party to run for the presidency. We’ve made great progress but still have a long way to go. Misogyny quickly ensued with too many men telling our next president to “lower her voice” and “smile.” Being a woman myself, I’ve experienced this as well while discussing politics, I can only hope that her presidency will change this.</p>
