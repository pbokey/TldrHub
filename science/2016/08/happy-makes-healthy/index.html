									<!-- Body of the Article -->
									<p>One of the biggest problems in this country is the rate of obesity that is plaguing the population. More than one-third of Americans are considered to be obese, while two-thirds of people are considered overweight. These statistics have led to an overwhelming amount of people who are willing to participate in fad diets, and even more extremes including eating disorders and ingesting tapeworms (illegal in the US but still terrifying).
									</p>

									<p>
									There is such a desire to reach perfection quickly through diets and extremes that promise to shred pounds in four weeks—some even more accelerated. Every time a celebrity who has a so-called “ideal body type” recommends a new fad diet, people will jump on it faster than a 90s kid can download Pokémon Go. The Sundial posted a review on how fad diets can be detrimental and included that fad diets can lead to fatigue, weakness, and heart disease, but most importantly these diets are not sustainable for life. Weight studies show that if you lose weight fast, you’re likely to gain weight back just as quickly.
									</p>

									<p>
									According to National Institutes of Health, obesity in adults has risen about 25% since the 90s. This rise is influenced by the reach that the media has on people of all ages. The media spreads this vision of perfection that only 5% of the population are born to look like. Let’s face it: not all people can look like Gigi Hadid no matter how hard we try. The only thing the average person can do is reach his or her own idea of perfection physically and mentally. 
									</p>

									<p>
									The American Heart Association wrote that losing weight takes willingness to educate oneself. The best thing that you can do is to make a weekly plan of what you would like to eat and then do it. This is also a way to save money and reduce the food that you waste, and to get moving on top of that. Going for walks or any kind of movement is so important, and your whole body will thank you. One of the biggest clichés you can hear is to drink loads of water—your body needs it and your skin will reflect it. The University of Wisconsin wrote an article highlighting your organs (and your skin’s) need for proper hydration to rid the body of any unwanted toxins.
									</p>  

									<p>
									Lastly, stay motivated. Getting healthy is not going to happen overnight, and getting fit is not always going to be fun. If you want an ice cream then eat ice cream, but not every day! The goal should not be to lose weight, but to become happy in your own skin and show that happiness in everyday life. There is also a stereotype that skinny people live longer. This is far from true. According to a Harvard School of Public Health study, it is actually happiness and a positive outlook that can increase the span of one’s life.  Being optimistic, surrounding yourself with a good span of people, as well as becoming confident in healthy in the skin you are in can help pave the way to a long happy and healthy lifestyle.
