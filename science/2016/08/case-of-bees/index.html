							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>The bee population has been in decline since the late 1990s due to the use of heavy pesticides spreading beyond the fields of treated crops and going into nature—anywhere a bee might be found. The effect of pesticides on bee populations can happen instantly or indirectly, like an exterminator killing a “pest” that supports the bees’ habitat. Bees pollinate <a href = http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture/save-the-bees> 90 percent of the world’s nutrition</a>, and with pesticides rapidly killing them in colony collapses (the instant loss of a single colony), there will not be enough bees for humans to live. Failure to save the bees from extinction could lead to food shortage and eventually even human extinction.</p>
							<p>
							What exactly is killing the bees? One of the most devastating causes is pesticides used on farm crops. Pesticides are used to kill the pests on crops, but they also kill the insects that aren’t pests: the ones who help grow the food. Pesticides and herbicides are intended to protect the food we grow, but when they spread into the wild, they kill off feral bees’ normal food source (wild flowering plants that we often overlook). This leaves them with no other option than to look for nectar in a farm coated with pesticides,<a href = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130116> which leads to other complications </a>. The bees can die immediately from the pesticides on the crops they are trying to pollinate, or they can die through more indirect ways, like not being able to make it back to the hive and dying as they run out of energy (one possible reason for colony collapse). In Oregon in June 2013, <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/20/bees-dead-oregon-target-_n_3472870.html"> 25,000 dead bees were found in a Target parking lot.</a> This mass death was caused by pesticide use on nearby trees. This was the largest documented colony collapse in the western US.</p>
							<p>
							As mentioned earlier, bees pollinate 90% of all our food, according to Greenpeace. Other pollinators (such as bats, butterflies, and wasps) pollinate plants, but do not contribute as much as bees do and could not keep up with the amount of production in the areas where hives and bees reside. In addition, these alternative pollinators would also be killed off by the same pesticides that are harming bees. The loss of bees would leave us without a safety net. Without our main pollinators, humans would die as a species from lack of food. It would decimate our livestock as well as crop growth, since commercial livestock are fed with crops pollinated by bees.</p>
							<p>
							So, what can we do to fix it? It is up to us to put restrictions on the type and amounts of pesticides farms use to crop dust. It is up to us to save the bees by supporting bee keepers and being aware of the decline. We must spread the word and spread awareness of declining bee population and make sure this critical issue is not brushed aside by those who could help the most.
