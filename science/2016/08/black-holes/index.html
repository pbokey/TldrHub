							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>

							<p>
							Dark matter. Sure, it sounds science-y (and a bit emo), but what is dark matter? As it turns out, you don’t actually need to be an astrophysicist to figure this one out.
							</p>

							<p>
							It’s matter that’s dark.
							</p>

							<p>
							What astronomers mean by that is: dark matter is matter that doesn’t emit light. This means we can’t see it in telescopes, and, unless it’s interacting with matter we can see, we have no way of detecting its presence. However, we know for sure that it’s out there because of how it affects matter that does emit light, or luminous matter. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Dark matter was <a href = "http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/galaxies/imagine/hidden_mass.html">first theorized in 1932 by astronomer Jan Oort.</a> He observed the orbital velocities of stars about the center of the Milky Way, and discovered that they were moving faster than they should. Using a <a href = "http://www.astronomynotes.com/gravappl/s8.htm">simple equation</a>, he concluded that there must be more mass in the galaxy than he could observe. So far, his conclusion is right. 
							</p>

							<p>
							As far as we can tell, in each galaxy there is a uniformly distributed halo of dark stuff flying around that contributes to the mass of the galaxy as a whole, but we cannot detect it on its own. Overall, <a href = "http://www.space.com/11642-dark-matter-dark-energy-4-percent-universe-panek.html">our entire universe is 96% dark matter and dark energy</a>. That means everything we can see — every planet, star, galaxy — constitutes only 4% of the universe’s matter.
							</p>

							<p>
							So, we know it’s out there, we know there’s a lot of it; but what is it? This is the question scientists are still working on. There are teams working on separate projects, all testing their ideas about what they think dark matter is. Some teams are investigating if it could be loads of tiny particles that don’t like to interact with regular matter, but still have mass (see <a href = "http://phys.org/news/2015-12-machos-wimpsmeet-candidates-dark.html">WIMPs and Axions</a>). Another theory suggests that dark matter could be a bunch of neutron and dwarf stars that aren’t accounted for — a likely possibility seeing as they don’t emit light and are difficult to detect (see <a href = "http://phys.org/news/2015-12-machos-wimpsmeet-candidates-dark.html">MACHOs</a>). However, a new theory has recently emerged that shows a lot of promise.
							</p>

							<p>
							On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) <a href ="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211">detected and confirmed the first ever recorded black hole merger</a>. The two black holes were 29 and 36 times the mass of the sun, respectively, and when they merged they released three solar masses of pure energy. Most black holes are either found at the centers of galaxies, or they’re formed when a huge star dies and collapses under its own weight. The black holes at the centers of galaxies are “supermassive”. They range anywhere from a million to several billion times the mass of the sun. This size can only be achieved because matter from the galaxy continually falls into the black hole, giving it a constant source of stuff that makes it bigger. Stellar mass black holes, on the other hand, are formed from just one star collapsing, and are typically between 4 and 20 or so solar masses. 
							</p>

							<p>
							A third kind of black hole could explain the problem of missing matter: primordial black holes. These black holes have been around since the beginning of the universe itself: the Big Bang. Almost instantly after the universe exploded into existence, some areas of the early expanding cosmos were denser than others. Some of these areas became so dense and heavy that their gravitational pull inward on themselves was stronger than any outward resisting force their molecules could supply. This critical density led to the creation of black holes—not just any kind of black hole, but a primordial black hole, meaning a black hole formed around the same time as the beginning of the universe. Scientists speculate every primordial black hole in existence <a href ="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-scientist-suggests-possible-link-between-primordial-black-holes-and-dark-matter">was formed in the first thousandth of a second</a> after the Big Bang.
							</p>

							<p>
							So, why do we think primordial black holes could be an explanation for dark matter? Well, for one, <a href = "http://www.space.com/33122-dark-matter-black-hole-connection.html">there appear to be a lot of them</a>. The odds of any two objects in the universe colliding are very small, and two black hole mergers have already been detected in the short time we’ve been looking for them, indicating that there may be enough out there to make mergers a common occurrence. Secondly, they would be nearly undetectable except for when they merge and produce gravitational waves. And third, their uniform distribution accounts for all the dark matter behavior since the beginning of time, including the existence of black holes that are neither stellar mass nor supermassive. 
							</p>

							<p>
							While it’s one possibility of many, the universe’s biggest secret could be as simple as a bunch of black holes that have been hiding out of sight since the creation of time itself. This theory will be put to test by the continuing observations of LIGO and the soon-to-be-built <a href = "https://www.elisascience.org/">eLISA</a>, the gravitational-wave-detecting space station that will offer unparalleled accuracy in monitoring low-level gravitational fluctuations. These detectors will let us see black hole activity for the first time ever, finally giving us an eye that can see into the dark. If dark matter really is the product of black holes made from the Big Bang, the mystery of dark matter will likely be brought into the light within our lifetimes.
