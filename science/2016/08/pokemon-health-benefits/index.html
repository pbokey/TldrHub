								<!-- Body of the Article -->
								<p>
								I stopped playing Pokémon after its 4th generation installment simply because I felt the games were too repetitive. However, I must admit I was incredibly excited when Pokémon GO was announced.  Pokémon GO is an app that allows you to catch and interact with virtual creatures in your area using your GPS. For example, I could walk to a nearby park and catch some grass-type Pokémon.  As I write this article, it has only been eleven days since the app’s release, and it has already caused mild controversy within the media. News reports criticize the app’s battery use and how dangerous the app can be, although one can argue that it has done more good than bad. Within this article I intend to show how Pokémon GO is simply fun and good for your health.
								</p>
	     						
	     						<p>
	     						First off, let’s start by observing how popular the app is.  According to techcrunch.com, 10% of Android devices had downloaded Pokémon GO less than two weeks after its launch on July 6. This may not sound like a big number until you consider that a day after launched, it had more downloads than Tinder, the well-established dating app. What’s even more impressive is that users are spending more time playing Pokémon GO than they are on Twitter and Facebook. Why does all of this matter, though?
	     						</p>
	     						
	     						<p>
	     						Kids and adults alike have begun to educate themselves on their area’s local history. Not only does the game have you walk to find Pokémon, but it also has PokéStops, specific locations that help you on your adventure with special items. What makes these PokéStops so special is that they often tend to be in historic places like museums, churches, and local art exhibits. Another feature is that the game allows you to take pictures while catching Pokémon, making taking pictures of your environment a lot more interesting and fun.
	     						</p>
	   							
	   							<p>
	   							The greatest characteristic about this app is that it ignites curiosity in people of all ages and even has helped some cope with depression.  Adam Pletcher, an educational game designer, mentioned in an interview [http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2016/07/16/educators-gold-pokemon-go/87101090/] with USATODAY, “One thing this [app] is really showing us is that people want to connect. They want to play and be out there. And if they have an excuse to do it, they’ll take that excuse and go do it.”  Many times I have been told that technology is ruining my generation and keeps people from exploring nature, but this new app has totally reversed that idea.
	   							</p>

	    						<p>
	    						There is actually scientific evidence that people receive gratification from achievement of small tasks within the game. Jane McGonigal, a game designer, mentions in the same article, “Whenever the brain anticipates that something good can happen you get that little release of dopamine, which generates a sense of motivation and desire for the anticipated outcome. Our brain discounts the effort or energy required for you to pursue your goals. Pokémon GO is literally designed for continual dopamine release, because literally every step you take, something good could happen. I’ve never seen a game that is more effective at the sense that every moment of the day and (in) every physical place in the world, something good and interesting could happen.”  According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, over 18% of US citizens suffer from some sort of depression [https://www.adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics]. It will be interesting to see how Pokémon GO helps those with depression, since the whole design behind the game is to help people feel a sense of accomplishment and overall happiness through the completion of small goals.
	    						</p>
	     						
	     						<p>
	     						I could write all day on all the ways Pokémon GO can help with general health. Lately, all I have been hearing on the news has been purely negative in every category. Often I hear, read, or watch a story on someone killing another based on religion, gender, or race. I myself have felt that the world is innately a bad place. Then I see Pokémon GO users. People of all ages, races, genders and religion playing together in harmony, strangers who have nothing in common stopping on the street to talk about what they caught around the corner. It’s small things like these that give me hope for society. With this app, we put our differences aside and actually look at what we have in common, no matter how ridiculous it is.
