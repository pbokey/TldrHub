							<p class="tldr"> Mid-afternoon drowsiness is part of our natural biological processes, and scientific studies have shown that even a short nap greatly boosts productivity. One study showed that a 26-minute nap improves performance by 34 percent. Although people may face some difficulties when napping at work, those can be easily overcome. The main struggle workers face today with napping at work is that their bosses prohibit it. Just as employers allow lunch and restroom breaks, they need to allow each worker to take a half-hour-maximum nap every day.</p>

							<p>Last summer, I was lucky enough to work in an office that had a creepy vacant room in the back that no one ever entered. It had a desk, a chair, and some old files, and it was well-insulated from the rest of the office. A few times during my lunch break, I slipped back into that room for some “peace and quiet.” I closed the door, sat in the chair, crossed my feet on top of the desk, and closed my eyes. I didn’t have a car that I could sleep in, nor did I have my own closed-off office, so this was my only option when I needed to nap.</p>
							<p>As it turns out, there’s a biological reason for the need to nap. It’s not just sleep deprivation; most healthy humans experience a drowsy period during the mid-afternoon even when they’ve gotten enough sleep. The real reason, according to John Medina, a biologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is that humans have two natural processes that clash during this time. One, the circadian arousal system, wants to keep you awake, while the other, the homeostatic sleep drive, wants you to sleep. These processes release hormones and chemicals to achieve their goals, but they reach a stalemate in the mid-afternoon. “An equal tension now exists between the two drives,” Medina explains, “which extracts a great deal of energy to maintain.” The result is that we feel tired and want to nap.</p>
							<p>Science tells us that our need to nap is just as biological as our need to eat and use the bathroom. Why, then, are we allowed to take lunch breaks and restroom breaks, but not nap breaks? To put it simply, employers think it’s a waste of time to let people sleep when they could be working. In the thirty or so minutes it may take to nap, an employee could do any number of tasks that seem to have a greater effect than snoring and dreaming.</p> 
							<p>The problem here is that studies have repeatedly shown that napping actually boosts productivity. <a href = "http://www.jetlog.com/fileadmin/downloads/NASA_TM_94_108839.pdf">One study in particular</a>, led by a team of researchers working for NASA, found that a 26-minute nap boosted performance by 34 percent. This was measured on pilots flying airplanes, but it applies to any kind of job as well. This means that taking a nap for just half an hour can increase productivity for the next few hours by more than a third. Countless other studies, such as <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003943">this one</a>, have shown similar results.</p>
							<p>One critic writing for <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-20/napping-at-work-can-be-so-exhausting">Bloomberg</a> argues that napping at work simply isn’t practical. Most workplaces don’t have any good places to nap, it’s not comfortable, and you may have “pillow hair” or grogginess. Before addressing these points, let’s make something clear: you don’t have to fall all the way asleep to enjoy the benefits and boosts in productivity associated with napping. As mentioned earlier, the reason humans need to nap in the afternoon is that our internal processes consume a large amount of energy. You don’t have to get to sleep to recuperate from this — stretching out, closing your eyes, and letting your muscles and brain relax still help fight that clash of internal processes. Sleeping is more effective, but resting still helps.</p>
							<p>The first obstacle, then, is finding a place to nap. I’ve usually been able to rest in an office chair, as I described earlier. Most offices have some kind of chair or couch that would be suitable, and if not, you can nap in your car or a nearby public place. This brings us to another concern raised by that Bloomberg writer: the level of comfort in these places. If you’re an easy sleeper, this isn’t as pressing of an issue. If you’re like me, though, a very light sleeper, recall that you don’t have to fall asleep all the way to enjoy the benefits. Whenever I napped at work, I never actually fell asleep, but I was able to rest enough to avoid those dreadful mid-afternoon sleepies.</p>
							<p>What works for me doesn’t work for everyone, of course. I highly doubt that everyone is able to benefit from napping the same way that I do. But we know that it’s natural for people to become tired and lose productivity in the afternoon, and we know that napping can help fix this, at least for some people. Employers need to begin doing two things: first, allow workers to take twenty- to thirty-minute naps every day. Second, establish a space where workers can nap comfortably. For those who want to take advantage of this, it will boost morale, company loyalty, and, most importantly, productivity. </p>
