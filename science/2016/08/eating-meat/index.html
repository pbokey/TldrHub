								<!-- Body of the Article -->
								<p>I’ve been a vegetarian since July 21, 2015, and I can genuinely say it’s one of the best decisions I have ever made. It hasn’t exactly been easy, though. Growing up and living in the South where meat is considered to be the center of almost every meal, as well as being a former meat lover myself, it has definitely been difficult to kick old habits and create new ones. I used to believe I couldn’t live without meat because I loved it too much. I avoided looking into the lifestyle because I knew that I would be faced with the truth about what I was eating along with the decision to either ignore the truth or make efforts to change my ways. Yet, I quit cold turkey (pun intended) after having a few realizations about the reasons for going meatless.</p>
								<p><strong>“Why love one and then eat the other?”</strong> is a question that echoed in my mind as I came to my decision. A common answer would be that the animals we eat are less intelligent than the ones we domesticate. However, there have been many scientific studies that have shown that the animals we eat are more intelligent than we think. Pigs, for instance, have been taught to play video games, can show distinct emotions, and have been proven to be about as intelligent as a 3 year old toddler. Most of our society would also agree that animals like pigs, cows, chicks, and deer are cute, just as cats and dogs are. You’d never eat a dog or cat, and most people want any animal abuser put in prison. So why is it okay to eat other animals, why is it different?</p>
								<p><strong>“Meat is not the only source of protein”</strong> is a truth I repeatedly found as I researched a meatless diet. While meat may be high in protein, there are plenty of other ways to get your protein. Nuts, beans, soy, seeds, and lentils are just a few examples of foods that can easily get you the protein that you need. The same people who criticized me for “not being able to get protein” are the same people who are deficient in other macronutrients and tried to convince me that I needed things such as fried chicken and steak in my diet. The truth is that nearly everyone is deficient in various macronutrients and vitamins. Protein is not the holy grail of nutrition, and it is still easy for a vegetarian or vegan to obtain as are other vitamins and minerals.
								<p><strong>“Eating meat isn’t just a personal choice; it does affect others”</strong> is a realization contrary to what people usually try to conclude after they’ve heard logical arguments against the consumption of meat. However, this statement is totally true. Meat consumption not only affects the animals that are slaughtered, but it affects the environment and people around you as well. Factory farming is one of the leading contributors to the massive amounts of air pollution in our atmosphere. Factory farms emit hefty amounts of harmful gases like methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide (just to name a few) into the atmosphere. This not only intensifies the effects of climate change, but also hurts the farm workers, animals, and us. The animals that people eat also consume immense amounts of water and grain, as well as taking up huge amounts of land and contributing to the overuse of fossil fuels. Instead of putting these resources into supporting the increasingly large populations of animals bred for slaughter, we could use these resources to feed people directly. Why is it that so much of the Earth’s population is starving, when the water and grains put toward livestock could feed the planet?</p>
								<p>Above all, I realized that <strong>all animals – whether big, small, cute, ugly, friendly, or hostile– have a desire to live, just like humans do.</strong> Who am I to take away a life just for one fleeting moment of satisfaction of consuming meat? Many people say that it doesn’t make a difference, and that there are so many meat eaters that my decision to eat differently doesn’t matter. I believe that is the most dangerous way to think. Widespread change must first happen on the individual level. Realizing that a problem exists and choosing not to work to fix it because you think your choice won’t make a difference is saying that you believe your voice doesn’t matter.
