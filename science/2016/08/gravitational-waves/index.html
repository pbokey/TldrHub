							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>
							With the recent discovery of gravitational waves from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the internet has become abuzz. More than a century has been put to use studying these elusive white-whales of physics, but no one has specifically talked about their implications. More specifically, what does this mean for you or me, the consumers? With any scientific breakthrough, there are plenty of questions to answer. Once you understand the basic science behind a phenomenon, the uses for it number in the thousands.
							</p> 

							<p>
							To really understand what gravitational waves can do, we have to look at what they are. If you’re familiar with waves on the ocean, then this will be an easy thought. If waves on the ocean are energy passing through the water, then any wave is really just some kind of energy passing through a medium. When it comes to gravity, the same idea applies. As a massive object moves, it creates distortions in the dimensions of space and time. These distortions are gravitational waves, moving at the speed of light. Whenever you have really massive objects, say, two black holes that are orbiting each other, they’ll produce their own waves. These waves stretch and push space-time as they move along, <a href = "https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211">which is how LIGO detected them in February of 2016</a>.
							</p> 

							<p>
							The detectors in Louisiana are mind-blowingly sensitive. Though gravitational waves carry a lot of energy, the distortion from one is very small. If one were to pass through a star, it would only stretch it by the width of a human hair. Luckily for LIGO researchers, two supermassive black holes had collided 1.3 billion light-years away. This was a big enough event for the detectors to confirm without a doubt that the waves exist. As further proof, <a href = "https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160615">another detection was made in June</a>. A mere article can’t really put into perspective how astounding this discovery is. In 1893, <a href = "http://gsjournal.net/Science-Journals/Essays-Gravity/Download/5623">the possibility of gravitational waves</a> was discussed when light waves were being researched. Einstein predicted that they were possible with his Theory of Relativity, and for over 100 years scientists and engineers have been trying to make technology that can probe these small-but-powerful fluctuations.
							</p>

							<p>
							The discovery itself is amazing, but what does this mean for the future, and for our everyday lives?
 							</p>

							<p>
							Since finding these waves is such a big deal, scientists are concerned with creating more precise measurements of them so that they can detect them more consistently and start using them for other experiments. Multiple projects are planned in the next 10 or 20 years, using larger and more impressive instruments dedicated to finding these waves. As of now, there are about <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory">six different planned detectors</a> to be built between now and the 2030s. One planned observatory, LISA, is meant to be put in space and cover over five million kilometers. Through use of three separate ships, it will be able to gather more precise information about gravitational waves without interference from the Earth’s vibrations. In addition, the ones on the ground will gain more precise measurement with the use of more advanced materials, such as silica, and more updated equipment to remove interference from light and sound. 
							</p>

							<p>
							The information gained from studying these waves is priceless, considering they’re different from any kind of wave we’ve detected before. Gravitational waves don’t get obstructed by matter; they go right through it, since they’re ripples in space-time. If we could produce them and use them in communication devices, a light-speed signal would always arrive perfectly on time, regardless of the walls or buildings in the way, unlike the electromagnetic waves we currently use. Imagine having perfect cell service even at the center of the Earth!
							</p>

							<p>
							Regardless of how these waves act, the discovery of gravitational waves means that as a species we are getting better and better at confirming scientific possibilities. What’s next, string theory? Dark matter? No one knows for sure, but the fact remains that these advancements will be affecting everyday technology from now to centuries later.
