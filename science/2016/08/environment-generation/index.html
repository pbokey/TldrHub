								<!-- Body of the Article -->
								<p><span class="city" style = "display:none">ENTER CITY HERE IF APPLICABLE</span>Consistently asserting itself as a pressing issue in the minds of many millennials, the future of our environment is often overlooked by older generations.</p>
								<p>Maybe it’s because of our exposure to numerous recycling programs. Maybe it’s because we’ve witnessed the worst overall environmental conditions to date. Or, maybe it’s because we plan to be here for a while. Whatever the reason, environmental sustainability is an issue constantly in millennial minds and seldom in our parental counterparts.
								And you can’t blame them.</p>
								<p>As witnesses of the Cold War and the September 11th attacks, foreign policy and military strength are necessities. As victims of the 2008 recession, employment and the economic security stand out among other issues as most critical. Caring for their aged parents with their own retirements encroaching, our parents often bear healthcare and social security in mind. And now, the comparison of heating racial tensions to those of the 1990s has driven issues such as racial equality and gun control into the eyes of the public.</p>
								<p>Given the history that our parents alone have had to endure (and our grandparents have gone through so much more), it’s easy to understand why the environment takes a back seat. When an individual is worried about putting food on the table, future medical bills, and general safety in public places, issues such as air quality or deforestation seem miniscule.</p>
								<p>And it’s our responsibility to change that perception. But how?</p>
								<p>Firstly, it’s important to recognize that the opinions of older generations are decades in the making. Political beliefs are rarely changed overnight, and barring another catastrophic environmental disaster (Superstorm Sandy wasn’t even enough), public opinion on the environment won’t change anytime soon. That is, not the way that it needs to (the situation is improving but not fast enough).</p>
								<p>So, what can we do? A myriad of methods lies ready for us millennials to push our environmental agenda.</p>
								<p>Vote. Through the most basic and accessible channels of participation, we can support lawmakers with pro-environmental policies while opposing those who don’t.</p>
								<p>Be seen. Showing up for public gatherings in support of environmental sustainability is a great way to bring attention to the issue. Whether it’s a protest, a political rally, or…….
								Be heard. Don’t just write to your local congressmen; write to local companies and national corporations alike. Sign petitions. Join environmental interest groups such as the Sierra Club.
								Make small differences. Recycle. Support companies with pro-environment beliefs and actions. Carpool. Use public transportation.</p>
								<p>Whatever we do, it’s still something. And over time, because it’ll surely take some time, we will be noticed. And the added attention is what we need to spark more rapid improvements to our environmental situation.</p>
