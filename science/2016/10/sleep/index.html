Signs of sleep deprivation include decreased mood, energy, and physical activity, as well as sleeping during class, procrastination, and depression. Students can increase their quality of sleep by avoiding physical activity, caffeinated beverages, and electronic gadgets near bedtime.

							<!-- Body of the Article -->
							<p>College comes with many time-consuming responsibilities. Some students take on internships, jobs, athletics, clubs, and countless other extracurricular activities. Staying busy can have its positive outcomes such as improved time management and productivity skills. But with such busy schedules, some college students forget to allot an appropriate amount of time for sleep, one of our most important natural processes. Getting a good amount of sleep promotes a healthier lifestyle and produces happy human beings.</p>
							<p>
							“Eight hours of sleep per night is recommended for both males and females,” says Natalie Butler, a medical doctor and anesthesiologist with Health First Medical Center.</p>
							<p>Finding the time for eight hours of sleep a night can often be difficult. College students at the University of Florida tend to think the average student gets much less time for rest.</p>
							<p>“I think the average student at UF gets around six to seven hours of sleep. I personally get like five to six and often feel absolutely exhausted throughout the day,” said Kendall Bond, a first year student in the nursing program.</p>
							<p>Not receiving enough time to sleep can have adverse effects on schoolwork as well as physical and emotional health. Having a poor enough sleep schedule can lead to a medical condition called sleep deprivation.</p>
							<p>“Falling asleep during class, decreased mood, energy, physical activity, procrastination, and depression are all signs of sleep deprivation,” Dr. Butler said.</p>
							<p>These side effects may be more common than they seem. After asking several college students about their sleeping schedule, it seems as though a majority of students experience these conditions every day.</p>
							<p>“I get about six hours of sleep per night, which makes it difficult to get up for my morning classes,” Hunter Fishback, a first year engineering major at UF, said. “I’m often too tired to pay attention in morning classes and have little time at night to study for them due to all the other things I have going on.”</p>
							<p>Extra efforts should be taken by these students to increase the amount of hours they get to sleep each night. In order to perform at their full potential, students should feel rested and have enough energy to tackle their duties for the day. Certain measures can be taken to get more time to sleep or even improve the quality of rest. By doing this, students can get more out of their hours of sleep than usual.</p>
							<p>“Students can take some action to improve the quality of their sleep,” Dr. Butler said. “No caffeine at night, limiting stimulus from video games, cell phones, or physical activity can all improve a student’s quality of rest.”</p>
							<p>By being aware and keeping a conscious effort towards improving their sleep, students can change their sleeping habits, which will help them in academics, athletics, and general health.</p>
							<p>When well-rested, students are much less likely to procrastinate. Procrastination is oftentimes a student’s main downfall. Taking more time to sleep can increase the time a student spends working on assignments.</p>
							<p>Having more energy and being more attentive and focused during the day are all products of being well-rested, leading to happy, healthier students.</p>
